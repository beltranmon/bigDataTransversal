 Girl with a Pearl Earring,Tracy Chevalier,With precisely 35 canvases to his credit; the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer represents one of the great enigmas of 17th-century art. The meager facts of his biography have been gleaned from a handful of legal documents. Yet Vermeer's extraordinary paintings of domestic life; with their subtle play of light and texture; have come to define the Dutch golden age. His portrait of the anonymous Girl with a Pearl Earring has exerted a particular fascination for centuries—and it is this magnetic painting that lies at the heart of Tracy Chevalier's second novel of the same title.Girl with a Pearl Earring centers on Vermeer's prosperous Delft household during the 1660s. When Griet; the novel's quietly perceptive heroine; is hired as a servant; turmoil follows. First; the 16-year-old narrator becomes increasingly intimate with her master. Then Vermeer employs her as his assistant—and ultimately has Griet sit for him as a model.,3.90,638064,9981,art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring
 Art and Fear Observations on the Perils and Rewards of Artmaking,David Bayles,"""This is a book about making art. Ordinary art. Ordinary art means something like: all art not made by Mozart. After all; art is rarely made by Mozart-like people; essentially-statistically speaking-there aren't any people like that. Geniuses get made once-a-century or so; yet good art gets made all the time; so to equate the making of art with the workings of genius removes this intimately human activity to a strangely unreachable and unknowable place. For all practical purposes making art can be examined in great detail without ever getting entangled in the very remote problems of genius.""--from the Introduction",3.73,72630,1050,art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/187633.Art_and_Fear

 Concerning the Spiritual in Art,Wassily Kandinsky,"A pioneering work in the movement to free art from its traditional bonds to material reality; this book is one of the most important documents in the history of modern art. Written by the famous nonobjective painter Wassily Kandinsky (1866–1944); it explains Kandinsky's own theory of painting and crystallizes the ideas that were influencing many other modern artists of the period. Along with his own groundbreaking paintings; this book had a tremendous impact on the development of modern art.Kandinsky's ideas are presented in two parts. The first part; called ""About General Aesthetic;"" issues a call for a spiritual revolution in painting that will let artists express their own inner lives in abstract; non-material terms. Just as musicians do not depend upon the material world for their music; so artists should not have to depend upon the material world for their art. In the second part; ""About Painting;"" Kandinsky discusses the psychology of colors; the language of form and color; and the responsibilities of the artist. An Introduction by the translator; Michael T. H. Sadler; offers additional explanation of Kandinsky's art and theories; while a new Preface by Richard Stratton discusses Kandinsky's career as a whole and the impact of the book. Making the book even more valuable are nine woodcuts by Kandinsky himself that appear at the chapter headings.This English translation of Über das Geistige in der Kunst was a significant contribution to the understanding of nonobjectivism in art. It continues to be a stimulating and necessary reading experience for every artist; art student; and art patron concerned with the direction of 20th-century painting.",3.82,77650,346,art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/857502.Concerning_the_Spiritual_in_Art
 The Letters of Vincent van Gogh,Vincent van Gogh,A new selection of post-impressionist painter Vincent Van Gough's letters; The Letters of Vincent van Gogh put a human face on one of the most haunting figures in modern Western culture. In this Penguin Classics edition; the letters are selected and edited by Ronald de Leeuw; and translated by Arnold Pomerans in Penguin Classics.Few artists' letters are as self-revelatory as Vincent van Gogh's; and this selection; spanning his artistic career; sheds light on every facet of the life and work of this complex and tortured man. Engaging candidly and movingly with his religious struggles; his ill-fated search for love; his attacks of mental illness and his relation with his brother Theo; the letters contradict the popular myth of van Gogh as an anti-social madman and a martyr to art; showing instead a man of great emotional and spiritual depths. Above all; they stand as an intense personal narrative of artistic development and a unique account of the process of creation.The letters are linked by explanatory biographical passages; revealing van Gogh's inner journey as well as the outer facts of his life. This edition also includes the drawings that originally illustrated the letters.Vincent Willem van Gogh (1853-1890) was born in Holland. In 1885 he painted his first masterpiece; The Potato Eaters; a haunting scene of domestic poverty. A year later he began studying in Paris; where he met Gauguin; Toulouse-Lautrec and Seurat; who became very important influences on his work. In 1888 he left Paris for the Provencal landscape at Arles; the subject of many of his best works; including Sunflowers.If you enjoyed The Letters of Vincent van Gogh; you might also like 100 Artists Manifestos; available in Penguin Modern Classics.'If there was ever any doubt that Van Gogh's letters belong beside those great classics of artistic self-revelation; Cellini's autobiography and Delacroix's journal; this excellent new edition dispels it'The Times,4.05,76104,391,art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/395233.The_Letters_of_Vincent_van_Gogh

He is alienated and in love-and at the center of a narrowing; ever more dangerous circle.The Goldfinch combines vivid characters; mesmerizing language; and suspense; while plumbing with a philosopher's calm the deepest mysteries of love; identity; and art.

 On Photography,Susan Sontag,"First published in 1973; this is a study of the force of photographic images which are continually inserted between experience and reality. Sontag develops further the concept of 'transparency'. When anything can be photographed and photography has destroyed the boundaries and definitions of art; a viewer can approach a photograph freely with no expectations of discovering what it means. This collection of six lucid and invigorating essays; the most famous being ""In Plato's Cave""; make up a deep exploration of how the image has affected society.",3.84,38947,835,art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography
 MC Escher The Graphic Work,M.C. Escher,Presenting the structurally unthinkable as though it were a law of nature M.C. Escher was born in 1898 in Leeuwarden (Netherlands). He received his first drawing lessons during secondary school from F.W. van der Haagen; who also taught him the block printing; thus fostering Escher's innate graphic talents. From 1912 to 1922 he studied at the School of Architecture and Ornamental Design in Haarlem; where he was instructed in graphic techniques by S. Jessurun de Mesquita; who greatly influenced Escher's further artistic development. Between 1922 and 1934 the artist lived and worked in Italy. Afterwards Escher spent two years in Switzerland and five in Brussels before finally moving back to Barn in Holland; where he died in 1972. M.C. Escher is not a surrealist drawing us into his dream world; but an architect of perfectly impossible worlds who presents the structurally unthinkable as though it were a law of nature. The resulting dimensional and perspectival illusions bring us into confrontation with the limitations of our sensory perception.

 The Art Spirit,Robert Henri,In this book are the essential beliefs and theories of a great teacher and American artist; Robert Henri. While it embodies the entire system of his teaching; with much technical advice and critical comment for the student; it also contains inspiration for those to whom the happiness to be found through all the arts is important.No other American painter attracted such a large; intensely personal group of followers as Henri; whose death in 1929 brought to an end a life that has been completely devoted to art. He was an inspired artist and teacher who believed that everyone is vitally concerned in the happiness and wisdom to be found through the arts. Many of his paintings have been acquired by museums and private collectors. Among them are the Baltimore Museum of Art; the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the National Gallery of Art; the Whitney Museum of American Art; the Wichita Art Museum; and Yale University Art Gallery.,3.89,19811,184,art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/207781.The_Art_Spirit

 Michelangelo and the Popes Ceiling,Ross King,In 1508; despite strong advice to the contrary; the powerful Pope Julius II commissioned Michelangelo to paint the ceiling of the newly restored Sistine Chapel. With little experience as a painter (though famed for his sculpture David); Michelangelo was reluctant to begin the massive project. Michelangelo and the Pope's Ceiling recounts the four extraordinary years Michelangelo spent laboring over the vast ceiling while the power politics and personal rivalries that abounded in Rome swirled around him. Battling against ill health; financial difficulties; domestic problems; the pope's impatience; and a bitter rivalry with the brilliant young painter Raphael; Michelangelo created scenes so beautiful that they are considered one of the greatest masterpieces of all time. A panorama of illustrious figures converged around the creation of this great work-from the great Dutch scholar Desiderius Erasmus to the young Martin Luther-and Ross King skillfully weaves them through his compelling historical narrative; offering uncommon insight into the intersection of art and history.,3.77,32054,714,art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/737957.Michelangelo_and_the_Pope_s_Ceiling
 The Judgment of Paris The Revolutionary Decade That Gave the World Impressionism,Ross King,With a novelist's skill and the insight of an historian; bestselling author Ross King recalls a seminal period when Paris was the artistic center of the world; and the rivalry between Meissonier and Manet.While the Civil War raged in America; another revolution took shape across the Atlantic; in the studios of Paris: The artists who would make Impressionism the most popular art form in history were showing their first paintings amidst scorn and derision from the French artistic establishment. Indeed; no artistic movement has ever been quite so controversial. The drama of its birth; played out on canvas and against the backdrop of the Franco-Prussian War and the Commune; would at times resemble a battlefield; and as Ross King reveals; it would reorder both history and culture; and resonate around the world.,3.83,13623,328,art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56912.The_Judgment_of_Paris

 Van Gogh,Steven Naifeh,Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith galvanized readers with their astonishing Jackson Pollock: An American Saga; winner of the Pulitzer Prize for biography; a book acclaimed for its miraculous research and overwhelming narrative power. Now Naifeh and Smith have written another tour de force—an exquisitely detailed; compellingly readable; and ultimately heartbreaking portrait of creative genius Vincent van Gogh.Working with the full cooperation of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam; Naifeh and Smith have accessed a wealth of previously untapped materials. While drawing liberally from the artist’s famously eloquent letters; they have also delved into hundreds of unpublished family correspondences; illuminating with poignancy the wanderings of Van Gogh’s troubled; restless soul. Naifeh and Smith bring a crucial understanding to the larger-than-life mythology of this great artist—his early struggles to find his place in the world; his intense relationship with his brother Theo; his impetus for turning to brush and canvas; and his move to Provence; where in a brief burst of incandescent productivity he painted some of the best-loved works in Western art.The authors also shed new light on many unexplored aspects of Van Gogh’s inner world: his deep immersion in literature and art; his erratic and tumultuous romantic life; and his bouts of depression and mental illness.Though countless books have been written about Van Gogh; and though the broad outlines of his tragedy have long inhabited popular culture; no serious; ambitious examination of his life has been attempted in more than seventy years. Naifeh and Smith have re-created Van Gogh’s life with an astounding vividness and psychological acuity that bring a completely new and sympathetic understanding to this unique artistic genius whose signature images of sunflowers and starry nights have won a permanent place in the human imagination.,4.06,19589,463,art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40819475-van-gogh
 Camera Lucida Reflections on Photography,Roland Barthes,A graceful; contemplative volume; Camera Lucida was first published in 1979. Commenting on artists such as Avedon; Clifford; Mapplethorpe; and Nadar; Roland Barthes presents photography as being outside the codes of language or culture; acting on the body as much as on the mind; and rendering death and loss more acutely than any other medium. This groundbreaking approach established Camera Lucida as one of the most important books of theory on this subject; along with Susan Sontag's On Photography.,3.98,48361,673,art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/497164.Camera_Lucida
 On Ugliness,Umberto Eco,"In the mold of his acclaimed ""History of Beauty;"" renowned cultural critic Umberto Eco's ""On Ugliness"" is an exploration of the monstrous and the repellant in visual culture and the arts. What is the voyeuristic impulse behind our attraction to the gruesome and the horrible? Where does the magnetic appeal of the sordid and the scandalous come from? Is ugliness also in the eye of the beholder?Eco's encyclopedic knowledge and captivating storytelling skills combine in this ingenious study of the Ugly; revealing that what we often shield ourselves from and shun in everyday life is what we're most attracted to subliminally. Topics range from Milton's Satan to Goethe's Mephistopheles; from witchcraft and medieval torture tactics to martyrs; hermits; and penitents; from lunar births and disemboweled corpses to mythic monsters and sideshow freaks; and from Decadentism and picturesque ugliness to the tacky; kitsch; and camp; and the aesthetics of excess and vice. With abundant examples of painting and sculpture ranging from ancient Greek amphorae to Bosch; Brueghel; and Goya among others; and with quotations from the most celebrated writers and philosophers of each age; this provocative discussion explores in-depth the concepts of evil; depravity; and darkness in art and literature.",3.85,17725,167,art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/520738.On_Ugliness

 Frida A Biography of Frida Kahlo,Hayden Herrera,Hailed by readers and critics across the country; this engrossing biography of Mexican painter Frida Kahlo reveals a woman of extreme magnetism and originality; an artist whose sensual vibrancy came straight from her own experiences: her childhood near Mexico City during the Mexican Revolution; a devastating accident at age eighteen that left her crippled and unable to bear children; her tempestuous marriage to muralist Diego Rivera and intermittent love affairs with men as diverse as Isamu Noguchi and Leon Trotsky; her association with the Communist Party; her absorption in Mexican folklore and culture; and her dramatic love of spectacle.Here is the tumultuous life of an extraordinary twentieth-century woman -- with illustrations as rich and haunting as her legend.,3.96,52609,529,art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91767.Frida
 The Power of Art,Simon Schama,"""Great art has dreadful manners;"" Simon Schama observes wryly at the start of his epic and explosive exploration of the power; and whole point; of art. ""The hushed reverence of the gallery can fool you into believing masterpieces are polite things; visions that soothe; charm and beguile; but actually they are thugs. Merciless and wily; the greatest paintings grab you in a headlock; rough up your composure; and then proceed in short order to re-arrange your sense of reality. . . .""With the same disarming force; The Power of Art propels us on an eye-opening; breathtaking odyssey; zooming in on eight extraordinary masterpieces; from Caravaggio's David and Goliath to Picasso's Guernica. Jolting us far from the comfort zone of the hushed art gallery; Schama closes in on intense make-or-break turning points in the lives of eight great artists who; under extreme stress; created something unprecedented; altering the course of art forever.The embattled heroes—Caravaggio; Bernini; Rembrandt; David; Turner; Van Gogh; Picasso and Rothko—each in his own resolute way; faced crisis with steadfast defiance; pitting passion and conviction against scorn and short-sightedness. The masterpieces they created challenged convention; shattered complacency; shifted awareness and changed the way we look at the world.With vivid storytelling and powerfully evocative descriptive passages; Schama explores the dynamic personalities of the artists and the spirit of the times they lived through; capturing the flamboyant theatre of bourgeois life in Amsterdam; the passion and paranoia of Revolutionary Paris; and the carnage and pathos of Civil War Spain.Most compelling of all; The Power of Art traces the extraordinary evolution of eight ""eye-popping"" world-class works of art. Created in a bolt of illumination; such works ""tell us something about how the world is; how it is to be inside our skins; that no more prosaic source of wisdom can deliver. And when they do that; they answer; irrefutably and majestically; the nagging question of every reluctant art-conscript . . . 'OK; OK; but what's art really for?'""",3.90,16482,118,art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19797.The_Power_of_Art

 Brunelleschis Dome How a Renaissance Genius Reinvented Architecture,Ross King,"Brunelleschi's Dome is the story of how a Renaissance man bent men; materials; and the very forces of nature to build an architectural wonder. Not a master mason or carpenter; Filippo Brunelleschi was a goldsmith and clock maker. Over twenty-eight years; he would dedicate himself to solving puzzles of the dome's construction. In the process; he did nothing less than reinvent the field of architecture. He engineered the perfect placement of brick and stone (some among the most renowned machines of the Renaissance) to carry an estimated seventy million pounds hundreds of feet into the air; and designed the workers' platforms and routines so carefully that only one man died during the decades of construction. This drama was played out amid plagues; wars; political feuds; and the intellectual ferments of Renaissance Florence - events Ross King weaves into a story to great effect.

 The Diary of a Young Girl,Anne Frank,Discovered in the attic in which she spent the last years of her life; Anne Frank’s remarkable diary has become a world classic—a powerful reminder of the horrors of war and an eloquent testament to the human spirit. In 1942; with the Nazis occupying Holland; a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years; until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo; the Franks and another family lived cloistered in the “Secret Annexe” of an old office building.

On a May afternoon in 1943; an Army Air Forces bomber crashed into the Pacific Ocean and disappeared; leaving only a spray of debris and a slick of oil; gasoline; and blood. Then; on the ocean surface; a face appeared. It was that of a young lieutenant; the plane's bombardier; who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard. So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War.The lieutenant’s name was Louis Zamperini. In boyhood; he'd been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent; breaking into houses; brawling; and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager; he had channeled his defiance into running; discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile. But when war had come; the athlete had become an airman; embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight; a tiny raft; and a drift into the unknown.Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean; leaping sharks; a foundering raft; thirst and starvation; enemy aircraft; and; beyond; a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance; Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope; resolve; and humor; brutality with rebellion. His fate; whether triumph or tragedy; would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will.",4.36,789627,46650,biography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8664353-unbroken

 John Adams,David McCullough,"The enthralling; often surprising story of John Adams; one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived.In this powerful; epic biography; David McCullough unfolds the adventurous life-journey of John Adams; the brilliant; fiercely independent; often irascible; always honest Yankee patriot -- ""the colossus of independence;"" as Thomas Jefferson called him -- who spared nothing in his zeal for the American Revolution; who rose to become the second President of the United States and saved the country from blundering into an unnecessary war; who was learned beyond all but a few and regarded by some as ""out of his senses""; and whose marriage to the wise and valiant Abigail Adams is one of the moving love stories in American history. Like his masterly; Pulitzer Prize-winning biography Truman; David McCullough's John Adams has the sweep and vitality of a great novel. It is both a riveting portrait of an abundantly human man and a vivid evocation of his time; much of it drawn from an outstanding collection of Adams family letters and diaries. In particular; the more than one thousand surviving letters between John and Abigail Adams; nearly half of which have never been published; provide extraordinary access to their private lives and make it possible to know John Adams as no other major American of his founding era. As he has with stunning effect in his previous books; McCullough tells the story from within -- from the point of view of the amazing eighteenth century and of those who; caught up in events; had no sure way of knowing how things would turn out. George Washington; Benjamin Franklin; John Jay; the British spy Edward Bancroft; Madame Lafayette and Jefferson's Paris ""interest"" Maria Cosway; Alexander Hamilton; James Madison; the scandalmonger James Callender; Sally Hemings; John Marshall; Talleyrand; and Aaron Burr all figure in this panoramic chronicle; as does; importantly; John Quincy Adams; the adored son whom Adams would live to see become President. Crucial to the story; as it was to history; is the relationship between Adams and Jefferson; born opposites -- one a Massachusetts farmer's son; the other a Virginia aristocrat and slaveholder; one short and stout; the other tall and spare. Adams embraced conflict; Jefferson avoided it. Adams had great humor; Jefferson; very little. But they were alike in their devotion to their country. At first they were ardent co-revolutionaries; then fellow diplomats and close friends. With the advent of the two political parties; they became archrivals; even enemies; in the intense struggle for the presidency in 1800; perhaps the most vicious election in history. Then; amazingly; they became friends again; and ultimately; incredibly; they died on the same day -- their day of days -- July 4; in the year 1826. Much about John Adams's life will come as a surprise to many readers. His courageous voyage on the frigate Boston in the winter of 1778 and his later trek over the Pyrenees are exploits that few would have dared and that few readers will ever forget. It is a life encompassing a huge arc -- Adams lived longer than any president. The story ranges from the Boston Massacre to Philadelphia in 1776 to the Versailles of Louis XVI; from Spain to Amsterdam; from the Court of St. James's; where Adams was the first American to stand before King George III as a representative of the new nation; to the raw; half-finished Capital by the Potomac; where Adams was the first President to occupy the White House. This is history on a grand scale -- a book about politics and war and social issues; but also about human nature; love; religious faith; virtue; ambition; friendship and betrayal; and the far-reaching consequences of noble ideas. Above all; John Adams is an enthralling; often surprising story of one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived.",4.05,321677,6418,biography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2203.John_Adams

He argues that Musk is an amalgam of legendary inventors and industrialists including Thomas Edison; Henry Ford; Howard Hughes; and Steve Jobs.

 Alexander Hamilton,Ron Chernow,"An alternate cover edition can be found here.Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Chernow presents a landmark biography of Alexander Hamilton; the Founding Father who galvanized; inspired; scandalized; and shaped the newborn nation.In the first full-length biography of Alexander Hamilton in decades; Ron Chernow tells the riveting story of a man who overcame all odds to shape; inspire; and scandalize the newborn America. According to historian Joseph Ellis; 
Alexander Hamilton
 is “a robust full-length portrait; in my view the best ever written; of the most brilliant; charismatic and dangerous founder of them all.”Few figures in American history have been more hotly debated or more grossly misunderstood than Alexander Hamilton. Chernow’s biography gives Hamilton his due and sets the record straight; deftly illustrating that the political and economic greatness of today’s America is the result of Hamilton’s countless sacrifices to champion ideas that were often wildly disputed during his time. “To repudiate his legacy;” Chernow writes; “is; in many ways; to repudiate the modern world.” Chernow here recounts Hamilton’s turbulent life: an illegitimate; largely self-taught orphan from the Caribbean; he came out of nowhere to take America by storm; rising to become George Washington’s aide-de-camp in the Continental Army; coauthoring The Federalist Papers; founding the Bank of New York; leading the Federalist Party; and becoming the first Treasury Secretary of the United States.Historians have long told the story of America’s birth as the triumph of Jefferson’s democratic ideals over the aristocratic intentions of Hamilton. Chernow presents an entirely different man; whose legendary ambitions were motivated not merely by self-interest but by passionate patriotism and a stubborn will to build the foundations of American prosperity and power. His is a Hamilton far more human than we’ve encountered before—from his shame about his birth to his fiery aspirations; from his intimate relationships with childhood friends to his titanic feuds with Jefferson; Madison; Adams; Monroe; and Burr; and from his highly public affair with Maria Reynolds to his loving marriage to his loyal wife Eliza. And never before has there been a more vivid account of Hamilton’s famous and mysterious death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July of 1804.Chernow’s biography is not just a portrait of Hamilton; but the story of America’s birth seen through its most central figure. At a critical time to look back to our roots;

 The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,Rebecca Skloot,Her name was Henrietta Lacks; but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors; yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture; they are still alive today; though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale; they’d weigh more than 50 million metric tons—as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer; viruses; and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization; cloning; and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions.Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown; buried in an unmarked grave.Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey; from the “colored” ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta’s small; dying hometown of Clover; Virginia — a land of wooden slave quarters; faith healings; and voodoo — to East Baltimore today; where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells.Henrietta’s family did not learn of her “immortality” until more than twenty years after her death; when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials; her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows; the story of the Lacks family — past and present — is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans; the birth of bioethics; and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.Over the decade it took to uncover this story; Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family—especially Henrietta’s daughter Deborah; who was devastated to learn about her mother’s cells. She was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space? What happened to her sister; Elsie; who died in a mental institution at the age of fifteen? And if her mother was so important to medicine; why couldn’t her children afford health insurance?Intimate in feeling; astonishing in scope; and impossible to put down; The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery; as well as its human consequences.,4.07,604642,35072,biography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6493208-the-immortal-life-of-henrietta-lacks

 Educated,Tara Westover,"Tara Westover was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho; she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her ""head-for-the-hills bag"". In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother; a midwife and healer; and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard.Her father forbade hospitals; so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions; even burns from explosions; were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.Then; lacking any formal education; Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University; where she studied history; learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her; taking her over oceans and across continents; to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far; if there was still a way home.Educated is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers; Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.Librarian's note: An alternate cover edition can be found here",4.46,872694,72644,biography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35133922-educated
 Born a Crime Stories From a South African Childhood,Trevor Noah,The memoir of one man’s coming-of-age; set during the twilight of apartheid and the tumultuous days of freedom that followed. Trevor Noah’s unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal act: his birth. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents’ indiscretion; Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life; bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could; at any moment; steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa’s tyrannical white rule; Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure; living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle. Born a Crime is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man’s relationship with his fearless; rebellious; and fervently religious mother—his teammate; a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty; violence; and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life.,4.46,423217,38297,biography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29780253-born-a-crime

 Benjamin Franklin An American Life,Walter Isaacson,"Benjamin Franklin is the Founding Father who winks at us. An ambitious urban entrepreneur who rose up the social ladder; from leather-aproned shopkeeper to dining with kings; he seems made of flesh rather than of marble. In bestselling author Walter Isaacson's vivid and witty full-scale biography; we discover why Franklin seems to turn to us from history's stage with eyes that twinkle from behind his new-fangled spectacles. By bringing Franklin to life; Isaacson shows how he helped to define both his own time and ours.He was; during his 84-year life; America's best scientist; inventor; diplomat; writer; and business strategist; and he was also one of its most practical—though not most profound—political thinkers. He proved by flying a kite that lightning was electricity; and he invented a rod to tame it. He sought practical ways to make stoves less smoky and commonwealths less corrupt. He organized neighborhood constabularies and international alliances; local lending libraries and national legislatures. He combined two types of lenses to create bifocals and two concepts of representation to foster the nation's federal compromise. He was the only man who shaped all the founding documents of America: the Albany Plan of Union; the Declaration of Independence; the treaty of alliance with France; the peace treaty with England; and the Constitution. And he helped invent America's unique style of homespun humor; democratic values; and philosophical pragmatism.But the most interesting thing that Franklin invented; and continually reinvented; was himself. America's first great publicist; he was; in his life and in his writings; consciously trying to create a new American archetype. In the process; he carefully crafted his own persona; portrayed it in public; and polished it for posterity.Through it all; he trusted the hearts and minds of his fellow ""leather-aprons"" more than he did those of any inbred elite. He saw middle-class values as a source of social strength; not as something to be derided. His guiding principle was a ""dislike of everything that tended to debase the spirit of the common people."" Few of his fellow founders felt this comfort with democracy so fully; and none so intuitively.In this colorful and intimate narrative; Isaacson provides the full sweep of Franklin's amazing life; from his days as a runaway printer to his triumphs as a statesman; scientist; and Founding Father. He chronicles Franklin's tumultuous relationship with his illegitimate son and grandson; his practical marriage; and his flirtations with the ladies of Paris. He also shows how Franklin helped to create the American character and why he has a particular resonance in the twenty-first century.",4.00,117283,2149,biography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10883.Benjamin_Franklin

 Leonardo da Vinci,Walter Isaacson,Based on thousands of pages from Leonardo's astonishing notebooks and new discoveries about his life and work; Walter Isaacson weaves a narrative that connects his art to his science. He shows how Leonardo's genius was based on skills we can improve in ourselves; such as passionate curiosity; careful observation; and an imagination so playful that it flirted with fantasy. He produced the two most famous paintings in history; The Last Supper and the Mona Lisa. But in his own mind; he was just as much a man of science and technology. With a passion that sometimes became obsessive; he pursued innovative studies of anatomy; fossils; birds; the heart; flying machines; botany; geology; and weaponry. His ability to stand at the crossroads of the humanities and the sciences; made iconic by his drawing of Vitruvian Man; made him history's most creative genius,4.13,67856,4159,biography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci

 Team of Rivals The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,Doris Kearns Goodwin,Winner of the Lincoln PrizeAcclaimed historian Doris Kearns Goodwin illuminates Lincoln's political genius in this highly original work; as the one-term congressman and prairie lawyer rises from obscurity to prevail over three gifted rivals of national reputation to become president.On May 18; 1860; William H. Seward; Salmon P. Chase; Edward Bates; and Abraham Lincoln waited in their hometowns for the results from the Republican National Convention in Chicago. When Lincoln emerged as the victor; his rivals were dismayed and angry.Throughout the turbulent 1850s; each had energetically sought the presidency as the conflict over slavery was leading inexorably to secession and civil war. That Lincoln succeeded; Goodwin demonstrates; was the result of a character that had been forged by experiences that raised him above his more privileged and accomplished rivals. He won because he possessed an extraordinary ability to put himself in the place of other men; to experience what they were feeling; to understand their motives and desires.It was this capacity that enabled Lincoln as president to bring his disgruntled opponents together; create the most unusual cabinet in history; and marshal their talents to the task of preserving the Union and winning the war.We view the long; horrifying struggle from the vantage of the White House as Lincoln copes with incompetent generals; hostile congressmen; and his raucous cabinet. He overcomes these obstacles by winning the respect of his former competitors; and in the case of Seward; finds a loyal and crucial friend to see him through.This brilliant multiple biography is centered on Lincoln's mastery of men and how it shaped the most significant presidency in the nation's history.,4.25,159190,7222,biography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2199.Team_of_Rivals

 Cleopatra A Life,Stacy Schiff,The Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer brings to life the most intriguing woman in the history of the world: Cleopatra; the last queen of Egypt.Her palace shimmered with onyx; garnets; and gold; but was richer still in political and sexual intrigue. Above all else; Cleopatra was a shrewd strategist and an ingenious negotiator.Though her life spanned fewer than forty years; it reshaped the contours of the ancient world. She was married twice; each time to a brother. She waged a brutal civil war against the first when both were teenagers. She poisoned the second. Ultimately she dispensed with an ambitious sister as well; incest and assassination were family specialties. Cleopatra appears to have had sex with only two men. They happen; however; to have been Julius Caesar and Mark Antony; among the most prominent Romans of the day. Both were married to other women. Cleopatra had a child with Caesar and–after his murder–three more with his protégé. Already she was the wealthiest ruler in the Mediterranean; the relationship with Antony confirmed her status as the most influential woman of the age. The two would together attempt to forge a new empire; in an alliance that spelled their ends. Cleopatra has lodged herself in our imaginations ever since.Famous long before she was notorious; Cleopatra has gone down in history for all the wrong reasons. Shakespeare and Shaw put words in her mouth. Michelangelo; Tiepolo; and Elizabeth Taylor put a face to her name. Along the way; Cleopatra’s supple personality and the drama of her circumstances have been lost. In a masterly return to the classical sources; Stacy Schiff here boldly separates fact from fiction to rescue the magnetic queen whose death ushered in a new world order. Rich in detail; epic in scope; Schiff ‘s is a luminous; deeply original reconstruction of a dazzling life.,3.69,103188,5286,biography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7968243-cleopatra
 The Glass Castle,Jeannette Walls,"A tender; moving tale of unconditional love in a family that; despite its profound flaws; gave the author the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms.Jeannette Walls grew up with parents whose ideals and stubborn nonconformity were both their curse and their salvation. Rex and Rose Mary Walls had four children. In the beginning; they lived like nomads; moving among Southwest desert towns; camping in the mountains. Rex was a charismatic; brilliant man who; when sober; captured his children's imagination; teaching them physics; geology; and above all; how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary; who painted and wrote and couldn't stand the responsibility of providing for her family; called herself an ""excitement addict."" Cooking a meal that would be consumed in fifteen minutes had no appeal when she could make a painting that might last forever. Later; when the money ran out; or the romance of the wandering life faded; the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town -- and the family -- Rex Walls had done everything he could to escape. He drank. He stole the grocery money and disappeared for days. As the dysfunction of the family escalated; Jeannette and her brother and sisters had to fend for themselves; supporting one another as they weathered their parents' betrayals and; finally; found the resources and will to leave home. What is so astonishing about Jeannette Walls is not just that she had the guts and tenacity and intelligence to get out; but that she describes her parents with such deep affection and generosity. Hers is a story of triumph against all odds; but also a tender; moving tale of unconditional love in a family that despite its profound flaws gave her the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms. For two decades; Jeannette Walls hid her roots. Now she tells her own story.",4.28,931716,51861,biography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7445.The_Glass_Castle

 When Breath Becomes Air,Paul Kalanithi,"For readers of Atul Gawande; Andrew Solomon; and Anne Lamott; a profoundly moving; exquisitely observed memoir by a young neurosurgeon faced with a terminal cancer diagnosis who attempts to answer the question 'What makes a life worth living?'At the age of thirty-six; on the verge of completing a decade's worth of training as a neurosurgeon; Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. One day he was a doctor treating the dying; and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that; the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi's transformation from a naïve medical student ""possessed;"" as he wrote; ""by the question of what; given that all organisms die; makes a virtuous and meaningful life"" into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain; the most critical place for human identity; and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality.

What does it mean to have a child; to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving; exquisitely observed memoir. Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015; while working on this book; yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all.

 Washington A Life,Ron Chernow,The celebrated Ron Chernow provides a richly nuanced portrait of the father of America. With a breadth and depth matched by no other one-volume life; he carries the reader through Washington's troubled boyhood; his precocious feats in the French and Indian Wars; his creation of Mount Vernon; his heroic exploits with the Continental Army; his presiding over the Constitutional Convention and his magnificent performance as America's first president.Despite the reverence his name inspires Washington remains a waxwork to many readers; worthy but dull; a laconic man of remarkable self-control. But in this groundbreaking work Chernow revises forever the uninspiring stereotype. He portrays Washington as a strapping; celebrated horseman; elegant dancer and tireless hunter; who guarded his emotional life with intriguing ferocity. Not only did Washington gather around himself the foremost figures of the age; including James Madison; Alexander Hamilton; John Adams; and Thomas Jefferson; he orchestrated their actions to help realise his vision for the new federal government; define the separation of powers; and establish the office of the presidency.Ron Chernow takes us on a page-turning journey through all the formative events of America's founding.

 Bonhoeffer Pastor; Martyr; Prophet; Spy,Eric Metaxas,"As Adolf Hitler and the Nazis seduced a nation; bullied a continent; and attempted to exterminate the Jews of Europe; a small number of dissidents and saboteurs worked to dismantle the Third Reich from the inside. One of these was Dietrich Bonhoeffer--a pastor and author; known as much for such spiritual classics as ""The Cost of Discipleship ""and ""Life Together;"" as for his 1945 execution in a concentration camp for his part in the plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler.In the first major biography of Bonhoeffer in forty years; ""New York Times"" best-selling author Eric Metaxas takes both strands of Bonhoeffer's life―the theologian and the spy―to tell a searing story of incredible moral courage in the face of monstrous evil.

 Angelas Ashes,Frank McCourt,"Imbued on every page with Frank McCourt's astounding humor and compassion. This is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.""When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I managed to survive at all. It was; of course; a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood; and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood."" So begins the Pulitzer Prize winning memoir of Frank McCourt; born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick; Ireland. Frank's mother; Angela; has no money to feed the children since Frank's father; Malachy; rarely works; and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy-- exasperating; irresponsible and beguiling-- does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story. Frank lives for his father's tales of Cuchulain; who saved Ireland; and of the Angel on the Seventh Step; who brings his mother babies. Perhaps it is story that accounts for Frank's survival. Wearing rags for diapers; begging a pig's head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire; Frank endures poverty; near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors--yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence; exuberance and remarkable forgiveness.

 The Hiding Place The Triumphant True Story of Corrie Ten Boom,Corrie ten Boom,At one time Corrie ten Boom would have laughed at the idea that there would ever be a story to tell.

She was an old-maid watchmaker living contentedly with her spinster sister and their elderly father in the tiny Dutch house over their shop.

 Long Walk to Freedom,Nelson Mandela,Nelson Mandela is one of the great moral and political leaders of our time: an international hero whose lifelong dedication to the fight against racial oppression in South Africa won him the Nobel Peace Prize and the presidency of his country. Since his triumphant release in 1990 from more than a quarter-century of imprisonment; Mandela has been at the center of the most compelling and inspiring political drama in the world. As president of the African National Congress and head of South Africa's anti-apartheid movement; he was instrumental in moving the nation toward multiracial government and majority rule. He is revered everywhere as a vital force in the fight for human rights and racial equality. The foster son of a Thembu chief; Mandela was raised in the traditional; tribal culture of his ancestors; but at an early age learned the modern; inescapable reality of what came to be called apartheid; one of the most powerful and effective systems of oppression ever conceived. In classically elegant and engrossing prose; he tells of his early years as an impoverished student and law clerk in a Jewish firm in Johannesburg; of his slow political awakening; and of his pivotal role in the rebirth of a stagnant ANC and the formation of its Youth League in the 1950s. He describes the struggle to reconcile his political activity with his devotion to his family; the anguished breakup of his first marriage; and the painful separations from his children. He brings vividly to life the escalating political warfare in the fifties between the ANC and the government; culminating in his dramatic escapades as an underground leader and the notorious Rivonia Trial of 1964; at which he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Herecounts the surprisingly eventful twenty-seven years in prison and the complex; delicate negotiations that led both to his freedom and to the beginning of the end of apartheid. Finally he provides the ultimate inside account.,4.31,71001,3835,biography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/318431.Long_Walk_to_Freedom
 Dreams from My Father A Story of Race and Inheritance,Barack Obama,In this lyrical; unsentimental; and compelling memoir; the son of a black African father and a white American mother searches for a workable meaning to his life as a black American. It begins in New York; where Barack Obama learns that his father—a figure he knows more as a myth than as a man—has been killed in a car accident. This sudden death inspires an emotional odyssey—first to a small town in Kansas; from which he retraces the migration of his mother’s family to Hawaii; and then to Kenya; where he meets the African side of his family; confronts the bitter truth of his father’s life; and at last reconciles his divided inheritance.,3.90,199923,7773,biography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/88061.Dreams_from_My_Father
 The Wright Brothers,David McCullough,Librarian's note: An alternate cover edition can be found hereTwo-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize David McCullough tells the dramatic story-behind-the-story about the courageous brothers who taught the world how to fly: Wilbur and Orville Wright.On a winter day in 1903; in the Outer Banks of North Carolina; two unknown brothers from Ohio changed history. But it would take the world some time to believe what had happened: the age of flight had begun; with the first heavier-than-air; powered machine carrying a pilot.Who were these men and how was it that they achieved what they did?David McCullough; two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize; tells the surprising; profoundly American story of Wilbur and Orville Wright.Far more than a couple of unschooled Dayton bicycle mechanics who happened to hit on success; they were men of exceptional courage and determination; and of far-ranging intellectual interests and ceaseless curiosity; much of which they attributed to their upbringing. The house they lived in had no electricity or indoor plumbing; but there were books aplenty; supplied mainly by their preacher father; and they never stopped reading.When they worked together; no problem seemed to be insurmountable. Wilbur was unquestionably a genius. Orville had such mechanical ingenuity as few had ever seen. That they had no more than a public high school education; little money and no contacts in high places; never stopped them in their mission to take to the air. Nothing did; not even the self-evident reality that every time they took off in one of their contrivances; they risked being killed.In this thrilling book; master historian David McCullough draws on the immense riches of the Wright Papers; including private diaries; notebooks; scrapbooks; and more than a thousand letters from private family correspondence to tell the human side of the Wright Brothers' story; including the little-known contributions of their sister; Katharine; without whom things might well have gone differently for them.,4.13,78049,6158,biography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22609391-the-wright-brothers
 Hillbilly Elegy A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis,J.D. Vance,Hillbilly Elegy is a passionate and personal analysis of a culture in crisis—that of white working-class Americans. The disintegration of this group; a process that has been slowly occurring now for more than forty years; has been reported with growing frequency and alarm; but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside. J. D. Vance tells the true story of what a social; regional; and class decline feels like when you were born with it hung around your neck.The Vance family story begins hopefully in postwar America. J. D.’s grandparents were “dirt poor and in love;” and moved north from Kentucky’s Appalachia region to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. They raised a middle-class family; and eventually one of their grandchildren would graduate from Yale Law School; a conventional marker of success in achieving generational upward mobility. But as the family saga of Hillbilly Elegy plays out; we learn that J.D.'s grandparents; aunt; uncle; sister; and; most of all; his mother struggled profoundly with the demands of their new middle-class life; never fully escaping the legacy of abuse; alcoholism; poverty; and trauma so characteristic of their part of America. With piercing honesty; Vance shows how he himself still carries around the demons of his chaotic family history.A deeply moving memoir; with its share of humor and vividly colorful figures; Hillbilly Elegy is the story of how upward mobility really feels. And it is an urgent and troubling meditation on the loss of the American dream for a large segment of this country.,3.92,322867,29002,biography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27161156-hillbilly-elegy
 Titan The Life of John D Rockefeller; Sr,Ron Chernow,"John D. Rockefeller; Sr.--history's first billionaire and the patriarch of America's most famous dynasty--is an icon whose true nature has eluded three generations of historians. Now Ron Chernow; the National Book Award-winning biographer of the Morgan and Warburg banking families; gives us a history of the mogul ""etched with uncommon objectivity and literary grace . . . as detailed; balanced; and psychologically insightful a portrait of the tycoon as we may ever have"" (Kirkus Reviews). Titan is the first full-length biography based on unrestricted access to Rockefeller's exceptionally rich trove of papers. A landmark publication full of startling revelations; the book will indelibly alter our image of this most enigmatic capitalist.        Born the son of a flamboyant; bigamous snake-oil salesman and a pious; straitlaced mother; Rockefeller rose from rustic origins to become the world's richest man by creating America's most powerful and feared monopoly; Standard Oil. Branded ""the Octopus"" by legions of muckrakers; the trust refined and marketed nearly 90 percent of the oil produced in America.        Rockefeller was likely the most controversial businessman in our nation's history. Critics charged that his empire was built on unscrupulous tactics: grand-scale collusion with the railroads; predatory pricing; industrial espionage; and wholesale bribery of political officials. The titan spent more than thirty years dodging investigations until Teddy Roosevelt and his trustbusters embarked on a marathon crusade to bring Standard Oil to bay.        While providing abundant new evidence of Rockefeller's misdeeds; Chernow discards the stereotype of the cold-blooded monster to sketch an unforgettably human portrait of a quirky; eccentric original. A devout Baptist and temperance advocate; Rockefeller gave money more generously--his chosen philanthropies included the Rockefeller Foundation; the University of Chicago; and what is today Rockefeller University--than anyone before him. Titan presents a finely nuanced portrait of a fascinating; complex man; synthesizing his public and private lives and disclosing numerous family scandals; tragedies; and misfortunes that have never before come to light.        John D. Rockefeller's story captures a pivotal moment in American history; documenting the dramatic post-Civil War shift from small business to the rise of giant corporations that irrevocably transformed the nation. With cameos by Joseph Pulitzer; William Randolph Hearst; Jay Gould; William Vanderbilt; Ida Tarbell; Andrew Carnegie; Carl Jung; J. Pierpont Morgan; William James; Henry Clay Frick; Mark Twain; and Will Rogers; Titan turns Rockefeller's life into a vivid tapestry of American society in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It is Ron Chernow's signal triumph that he narrates this monumental saga with all the sweep; drama; and insight that this giant subject deserves.From the Hardcover edition.",4.13,22810,1150,biography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16121.Titan
 Eat; Pray; Love,Elizabeth Gilbert,A celebrated writer's irresistible; candid; and eloquent account of her pursuit of worldly pleasure; spiritual devotion; and what she really wanted out of life. Around the time Elizabeth Gilbert turned thirty; she went through an early-onslaught midlife crisis. She had everything an educated; ambitious American woman was supposed to want—a husband; a house; a successful career. But instead of feeling happy and fulfilled; she was consumed with panic; grief; and confusion. She went through a divorce; a crushing depression; another failed love; and the eradication of everything she ever thought she was supposed to be. To recover from all this; Gilbert took a radical step. In order to give herself the time and space to find out who she really was and what she really wanted; she got rid of her belongings; quit her job; and undertook a yearlong journey around the world—all alone. Eat; Pray; Love is the absorbing chronicle of that year. Her aim was to visit three places where she could examine one aspect of her own nature set against the backdrop of a culture that has traditionally done that one thing very well. In Rome; she studied the art of pleasure; learning to speak Italian and gaining the twenty-three happiest pounds of her life. India was for the art of devotion; and with the help of a native guru and a surprisingly wise cowboy from Texas; she embarked on four uninterrupted months of spiritual exploration. In Bali; she studied the art of balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence. She became the pupil of an elderly medicine man and also fell in love the best way—unexpectedly. An intensely articulate and moving memoir of self-discovery; Eat; Pray; Love is about what can happen when you claim responsibility for your own contentment and stop trying to live in imitation of society’s ideals. It is certain to touch anyone who has ever woken up to the unrelenting need for change.,3.57,1508922,54170,biography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19501.Eat_Pray_Love

In 1845; seven years after escaping to the North; he published Narrative; the first of three autobiographies.

 Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me And Other Concerns,Mindy Kaling,Mindy Kaling has lived many lives: the obedient child of immigrant professionals; a timid chubster afraid of her own bike; a Ben Affleck–impersonating Off-Broadway performer and playwright; and; finally; a comedy writer and actress prone to starting fights with her friends and coworkers with the sentence “Can I just say one last thing about this; and then I swear I’ll shut up about it?”  Perhaps you want to know what Mindy thinks makes a great best friend (someone who will fill your prescription in the middle of the night); or what makes a great guy (one who is aware of all elderly people in any room at any time and acts accordingly); or what is the perfect amount of fame (so famous you can never get convicted of murder in a court of law); or how to maintain a trim figure (you will not find that information in these pages). If so; you’ve come to the right book; mostly! In Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?; Mindy invites readers on a tour of her life and her unscientific observations on romance; friendship; and Hollywood; with several conveniently placed stopping points for you to run errands and make phone calls.

 Grant,Ron Chernow,"Ulysses S. Grant's life has typically been misunderstood. All too often he is caricatured as a chronic loser and inept businessman; fond of drinking to excess; or as the triumphant but brutal Union general of the Civil War; or as a credulous and hapless president whose tenure came to symbolize the worst excesses of the Gilded Age. These stereotypes don't come close to capturing adequately his spirit and the sheer magnitude of his monumental accomplishments. A biographer at the height of his powers; Chernow has produced a portrait of Grant that is a masterpiece; the first to provide a complete understanding of the general and president whose fortunes rose and fell with dizzying speed and frequency. Before the Civil War; Grant was flailing. His business ventures had been dismal; and despite distinguished service in the Mexican War; he ended up resigning from the army in disgrace amid recurring accusations of drunkenness. But in the Civil War; Grant began to realize his remarkable potential; soaring through the ranks of the Union army; prevailing at the Battle of Shiloh and in the Vicksburg campaign and ultimately defeating the legendary Confederate general Robert E. Lee after a series of unbelievably bloody battles in Virginia. Along the way Grant endeared himself to President Lincoln and became his most trusted general and the strategic genius of the war effort. His military fame translated into a two-term presidency; but one plagued by corruption scandals involving his closest staff. All the while Grant himself remained more or less above reproach. But; more importantly; he never failed to seek freedom and justice for black Americans; working to crush the Ku Klux Klan and earning the admiration of Frederick Douglass; who called him 'the vigilant; firm; impartial; and wise protector of my race."" After his presidency; he was again brought low by a trusted colleague; this time a dashing young swindler on Wall Street; but he resuscitated his image by working with Mark Twain to publish his memoirs; which are recognized as a masterpiece of the genre.  With his famous lucidity; breadth; and meticulousness; Chernow finds the threads that bind these disparate stories together; shedding new light on the man whom Walt Whitman described as ""nothing heroic... and yet the greatest hero."" His probing portrait of Grant's lifelong struggle with alcoholism transforms our understanding of the man at the deepest level. This is America's greatest biographer; bringing movingly to life one of America's finest but most underappreciated presidents. The definitive biography; Grant is a grand synthesis of painstaking research and literary brilliance that makes sense of all sides of Grant's life; explaining how this simple Midwesterner could at once be so ordinary and so extraordinary.",4.44,23987,2956,biography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34237826-grant
 Mans Search for Meaning,Viktor E.

Man's Search for Meaning has become one of the most influential books in America; it continues to inspire us all to find significance in the very act of living.,4.36,427799,22942,biography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4069.Man_s_Search_for_Meaning
 Tuesdays with Morrie,Mitch Albom,Maybe it was a grandparent; or a teacher or a colleague.

 Thomas Jefferson The Art of Power,Jon Meacham,In this magnificent biography; the Pulitzer Prize–winning author of American Lion and Franklin and Winston brings vividly to life an extraordinary man and his remarkable times. Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power gives us Jefferson the politician and president; a great and complex human being forever engaged in the wars of his era. Philosophers think; politicians maneuver. Jefferson’s genius was that he was both and could do both; often simultaneously. Such is the art of power. Thomas Jefferson hated confrontation; and yet his understanding of power and of human nature enabled him to move men and to marshal ideas; to learn from his mistakes; and to prevail. Passionate about many things—women; his family; books; science; architecture; gardens; friends; Monticello; and Paris—Jefferson loved America most; and he strove over and over again; despite fierce opposition; to realize his vision: the creation; survival; and success of popular government in America. Jon Meacham lets us see Jefferson’s world as Jefferson himself saw it; and to appreciate how Jefferson found the means to endure and win in the face of rife partisan division; economic uncertainty; and external threat. Drawing on archives in the United States; England; and France; as well as unpublished Jefferson presidential papers; Meacham presents Jefferson as the most successful political leader of the early republic; and perhaps in all of American history. The father of the ideal of individual liberty; of the Louisiana Purchase; of the Lewis and Clark expedition; and of the settling of the West; Jefferson recognized that the genius of humanity—and the genius of the new nation—lay in the possibility of progress; of discovering the undiscovered and seeking the unknown. From the writing of the Declaration of Independence to elegant dinners in Paris and in the President’s House; from political maneuverings in the boardinghouses and legislative halls of Philadelphia and New York to the infant capital on the Potomac; from his complicated life at Monticello; his breathtaking house and plantation in Virginia; to the creation of the University of Virginia; Jefferson was central to the age. Here too is the personal Jefferson; a man of appetite; sensuality; and passion. The Jefferson story resonates today not least because he led his nation through ferocious partisanship and cultural warfare amid economic change and external threats; and also because he embodies an eternal drama; the struggle of the leadership of a nation to achieve greatness in a difficult and confounding world.,3.99,33036,1963,biography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41021344-thomas-jefferson
 Theodore Rex,Edmund Morris,"Theodore Roosevelt and his two-term presidency (1901-9) deserve a king-size; seize-the-man biography - and Edmund Morris has provided one. ""TR"" typifies the ""can do"" American; his famous maxim; of course; was ""Speak softly but carry a big stick."" Morris presents eyewitness history through the voices of the makers and shakers. His exhilarating narrative will captivate readers; providing welcome confirmation that this nation can produce presidents who bring leadership to great issues; hold to their purpose; and shape the destinies of nations. President McKinley's assassination brought the 43-year-old TR a challenging presidency; one to which Morris is a clearsighted guide. At home; TR had to persuade Congress to curb competition-stifling corporate trusts; monopolistic transcontinental railroads; and unhygienic food industries that saw consumers as sheep. He also faced labor and racial strife. Abroad; the American presence in Cuba and the Philippines brought criticism; the Russo-Japanese conflict threatened major power shifts in the Far East and Europe; and a politically and financially fraught decision on the Central American canal route - Panama or Nicaragua? - had to be made. TR rose to every challenge. Despite the demands of family and social life; he read; wrote; and traveled extensively. Not least; TR put national parks and conservation of natural resources on the legislative agenda.All TR's notable contemporaries - including historian Henry Adams; naturalists John Burroughs and John Muir; robber barons E. H. Harriman and James J. Hill; poet Oliver Wendell Holmes; financier J. P. Morgan; fellow politician William Howard Taft; civil rights leader Booker T. Washington; and novelist Owen Wister - appear onstage; their clear voices projecting the excitement of the day.Morris is blessed with the imagination and skills to write gripping popular history. He doesn't dilute but illuminates events in presenting an account that immediately sparks interest and captures the mind. Readers will note that American interventionism abroad (today's major issue) was much debated during TR's presidency; when major interventional imperatives challenged the new superpower's tradition of relative restraint in foreign affairs.Theodore Rex is the long-awaited second volume of the TR saga. Morris delivered the first volume;

 Zero to One Notes on Startups; or How to Build the Future,Peter Thiel,If you want to build a better future; you must believe in secrets.The great secret of our time is that there are still uncharted frontiers to explore and new inventions to create. In Zero to One; legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things. Thiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation; even if we’re too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly; but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself.Doing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n; adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new; you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. Tomorrow’s champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today’s marketplace. They will escape competition altogether; because their businesses will be unique. Zero to One presents at once an optimistic view of the future of progress in America and a new way of thinking about innovation: it starts by learning to ask the questions that lead you to find value in unexpected places.,4.17,204008,6125,business,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18050143-zero-to-one

 The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People Powerful Lessons in Personal Change,Stephen R. Covey,When Stephen Covey first released The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People; the book became an instant rage because people suddenly got up and took notice that their lives were headed off in the wrong direction; and more than that; they realized that there were so many simple things they could do in order to navigate their life correctly. This book was wonderful education for people; education in how to live life effectively and get closer to the ideal of being a ‘success’ in life.But not everyone understands Stephen Covey’s model fully well; or maybe there are some people who haven’t read it yet. This is definitely true because we still see so much failure all around us. Now; I am not saying that by using Covey’s model; or anyone else’s model for that matter; you can become a sure-shot success; but at least we should have seen many more successes around us already judging by the number of copies the book has sold! So; where is the shortcoming?There are two main problems here; and we are talking only about the people who have read the book already. The first problem is that most people are too lazy to implement the ideals of Stephen Covey in their lives. They consider his masterpiece of a book as a mere coffee-table book or a book that you use for light reading when you are traveling and then forget all about it. They do not realize that this book contains life-changing information. Or; they take the information and do not make the effort to actually utilize it so that it becomes knowledge for them.The second problem is that a lot of people have a myopic view of Covey’s ideals. These are people who are impressed by the book already. If you ask them what the seven habits are; they can rattle them off end to end; but then they miss the larger picture. They do not understand that Covey was trying to tell more than he wrote in words. There are hidden implications in this book; yes; and a lot of people have just failed to see through them.That is what we are trying to do. We are trying to show you how Covey’s book; or rather; his model; was a complete model in itself. There was nothing amiss about it. If you implement it; there should be no aspect of your life that should go untouched. The only thing is that you have to understand these ideals and try to implement them in your life.But; before we barge into that area; it is extremely important to understand what these ideals are. What was the model that was propounded by Stephen Covey in his mega-famous book? We shall begin by trying to understand his model first; and then interpret it in such a way that it pertains to every aspect of our life,4.12,545844,10823,business,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36072.The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People
 The Tipping Point How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,Malcolm Gladwell,An alternate cover edition exists here.The tipping point is that magic moment when an idea; trend; or social behavior crosses a threshold; tips; and spreads like wildfire. Just as a single sick person can start an epidemic of the flu; so too can a small but precisely targeted push cause a fashion trend; the popularity of a new product; or a drop in the crime rate. This widely acclaimed bestseller; in which Malcolm Gladwell explores and brilliantly illuminates the tipping point phenomenon; is already changing the way people throughout the world think about selling products and disseminating ideas.Gladwell introduces us to the particular personality types who are natural pollinators of new ideas and trends; the people who create the phenomenon of word of mouth. He analyzes fashion trends; smoking; children's television; direct mail; and the early days of the American Revolution for clues about making ideas infectious; and visits a religious commune; a successful high-tech company; and one of the world's greatest salesmen to show how to start and sustain social epidemics.,3.98,705773,13825,business,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2612.The_Tipping_Point

 Start with Why How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action,Simon Sinek,Why do you do what you do?Why are some people and organizations more innovative; more influential; and more profitable than others? Why do some command greater loyalty from customers and employees alike? Even among the successful; why are so few able to repeat their success over and over?People like Martin Luther King Jr.; Steve Jobs; and the Wright Brothers might have little in common; but they all started with why. It was their natural ability to start with why that enabled them to inspire those around them and to achieve remarkable things.In studying the leaders who've had the greatest influence in the world; Simon Sinek discovered that they all think; act; and communicate in the exact same way—and it's the complete opposite of what everyone else does. Sinek calls this powerful idea The Golden Circle; and it provides a framework upon which organizations can be built; movements can be lead; and people can be inspired. And it all starts with WHY.Any organization can explain what it does; some can explain how they do it; but very few can clearly articulate why. WHY is not money or profit—those are always results. WHY does your organization exist? WHY does it do the things it does? WHY do customers really buy from one company or another? WHY are people loyal to some leaders; but not others?Starting with WHY works in big business and small business; in the nonprofit world and in politics. Those who start with WHY never manipulate; they inspire. And the people who follow them don't do so because they have to; they follow because they want to.Drawing on a wide range of real-life stories; Sinek weaves together a clear vision of what it truly takes to lead and inspire. This book is for anyone who wants to inspire others or who wants to find someone to inspire them.,4.08,131854,6386,business,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7108725-start-with-why

 Freakonomics A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything,Steven D. Levitt,Which is more dangerous; a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? Freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple; unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.Through forceful storytelling and wry insight; Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is; at root; the study of incentives -- how people get what they want; or need; especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics; they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well; everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world; despite a surfeit of obfuscation; complication; and downright deceit; is not impenetrable; is not unknowable; and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt; through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking; shows how to see through all the clutter.Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work; then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.(front flap),3.98,727608,16532,business,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1202.Freakonomics
 The Innovators Dilemma The Revolutionary Book that Will Change the Way You Do Business,Clayton M. Christensen,"Harvard professor Clayton M. Christensen says outstanding companies can do everything right and still lose their market leadership -- or worse; disappear completely.

 The Power of Habit Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business,Charles Duhigg,A young woman walks into a laboratory. Over the past two years; she has transformed almost every aspect of her life. She has quit smoking; run a marathon; and been promoted at work. The patterns inside her brain; neurologists discover; have fundamentally changed.Marketers at Procter & Gamble study videos of people making their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze; on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly; one of them detects a nearly imperceptible pattern—and with a slight shift in advertising; Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year.An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employees—how they approach worker safety—and soon the firm; Alcoa; becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones.What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives. They succeeded by transforming habits.In The Power of Habit; award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives; Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation. Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change; despite years of trying; while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where; exactly; they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps; Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz; and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King; Jr. We go inside Procter & Gamble; Target superstores; Rick Warren’s Saddleback Church; NFL locker rooms; and the nation’s largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success; life and death.At its core; The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly; losing weight; raising exceptional children; becoming more productive; building revolutionary companies and social movements; and achieving success is understanding how habits work. Habits aren’t destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows; by harnessing this new science; we can transform our businesses; our communities; and our lives.,4.11,361257,17689,business,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12609433-the-power-of-habit
 Good to Great Why Some Companies Make the Leap and Others Dont,James C. Collins,To find the keys to greatness; Collins's 21-person research team read and coded 6;000 articles; generated more than 2;000 pages of interview transcripts and created 384 megabytes of computer data in a five-year project. The findings will surprise many readers and; quite frankly; upset others.The ChallengeBuilt to Last; the defining management study of the nineties; showed how great companies triumph over time and how long-term sustained performance can be engineered into the DNA of an enterprise from the very beginning. But what about the company that is not born with great DNA? How can good companies; mediocre companies; even bad companies achieve enduring greatness? The StudyFor years; this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so; what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great?The StandardsUsing tough benchmarks; Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap; the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years; better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world's greatest companies; including Coca-Cola; Intel; General Electric; and Merck. The ComparisonsThe research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good? The FindingsThe findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice. The findings include:Level 5 Leaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership required to achieve greatness.The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence.A Culture of Discipline: When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship; you get the magical alchemy of great results. Technology Accelerators: Good-to-great companies think differently about the role of technology.The Flywheel and the Doom Loop: Those who launch radical change programs and wrenching restructurings will almost certainly fail to make the leap.,4.12,137154,4613,business,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76865.Good_to_Great
 Made to Stick Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die,Chip Heath,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER - The instant classic about why some ideas thrive; why others die; and how to improve your idea's chances--essential reading in the ""fake news"" era.Mark Twain once observed; ""A lie can get halfway around the world before the truth can even get its boots on."" His observation rings true: Urban legends; conspiracy theories; and bogus news stories circulate effortlessly. Meanwhile; people with important ideas--entrepreneurs; teachers; politicians; and journalists--struggle to make them ""stick.""In Made to Stick; Chip and Dan Heath reveal the anatomy of ideas that stick and explain ways to make ideas stickier; such as applying the human scale principle; using the Velcro Theory of Memory; and creating curiosity gaps. Along the way; we discover that sticky messages of all kinds--from the infamous ""kidney theft ring"" hoax to a coach's lessons on sportsmanship to a vision for a new product at Sony--draw their power from the same six traits.Made to Stick will transform the way you communicate. It's a fast-paced tour of success stories (and failures): the Nobel Prize-winning scientist who drank a glass of bacteria to prove a point about stomach ulcers; the charities who make use of the Mother Teresa Effect; the elementary-school teacher whose simulation actually prevented racial prejudice.Provocative; eye-opening; and often surprisingly funny; Made to Stick shows us the vital principles of winning ideas--and tells us how we can apply these rules to making our own messages stick.",3.96,76802,2801,business,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/69242.Made_to_Stick

Selling the shoes from the trunk of his lime green Plymouth Valiant; Knight grossed $8;000 his first year. Today; Nike’s annual sales top $30 billion.

 Lean In Women; Work; and the Will to Lead,Sheryl Sandberg,Sheryl Sandberg’s Lean In is a massive cultural phenomenon and its title has become an instant catchphrase for empowering women. The book soared to the top of bestseller lists internationally; igniting global conversations about women and ambition. Sandberg packed theatres; dominated opinion pages; appeared on every major television show and on the cover of Time magazine; and sparked ferocious debate about women and leadership. Ask most women whether they have the right to equality at work and the answer will be a resounding yes; but ask the same women whether they'd feel confident asking for a raise; a promotion; or equal pay; and some reticence creeps in. The statistics; although an improvement on previous decades; are certainly not in women's favour – of 197 heads of state; only twenty-two are women. Women hold just 20 percent of seats in parliaments globally; and in the world of big business; a meagre eighteen of the Fortune 500 CEOs are women. In Lean In; Sheryl Sandberg – Facebook COO and one of Fortune magazine's Most Powerful Women in Business – draws on her own experience of working in some of the world's most successful businesses and looks at what women can do to help themselves; and make the small changes in their life that can effect change on a more universal scale.,3.95,229615,13153,business,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16071764-lean-in
 Built to Last Successful Habits of Visionary Companies,James C. Collins,"""This is not a book about charismatic visionary leaders. It is not about visionary product concepts or visionary products or visionary market insights. Nor is it about just having a corporate vision. This is a book about something far more important; enduring; and substantial. This is a book about visionary companies."" So write Jim Collins and Jerry Porras in this groundbreaking book that shatters myths; provides new insights; and gives practical guidance to those who would like to build landmark companies that stand the test of time.Drawing upon a six-year research project at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business; Collins and Porras took eighteen truly exceptional and long-lasting companies -- they have an average age of nearly one hundred years and have outperformed the general stock market by a factor of fifteen since 1926 -- and studied each company in direct comparison to one of its top competitors. They examined the companies from their very beginnings to the present day -- as start-ups; as midsize companies; and as large corporations. Throughout; the authors asked: ""What makes the truly exceptional companies different from other companies?""What separates General Electric; 3M; Merck; Wal-Mart; Hewlett-Packard; Walt Disney; and Philip Morris from their rivals? How; for example; did Procter & Gamble; which began life substantially behind rival Colgate; eventually prevail as the premier institution in its industry? How was Motorola able to move from a humble battery repair business into integrated circuits and cellular communications; while Zenith never became dominant in anything other than TVs? How did Boeing unseat McDonnell Douglas as the world's best commercial aircraft company -- what did Boeing have that McDonnell Douglas lacked?By answering such questions; Collins and Porras go beyond the incessant barrage of management buzzwords and fads of the day to discover timeless qualities that have consistently distinguished out-standing companies. They also provide inspiration to all executives and entrepreneurs by destroying the false but widely accepted idea that only charismatic visionary leaders can build visionary companies.Filled with hundreds of specific examples and organized into a coherent framework of practical concepts that can be applied by managers and entrepreneurs at all levels; Built to Last provides a master blueprint for building organizations that will prosper long into the twenty-first century and beyond.",4.02,61456,713,business,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4122.Built_to_Last
 Creativity; Inc Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration,Ed Catmull,“What does it mean to manage well?”From Ed Catmull; co-founder (with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter) of Pixar Animation Studios; comes an incisive book about creativity in business—sure to appeal to readers of Daniel Pink; Tom Peters; and Chip and Dan Heath. Creativity; Inc. is a book for managers who want to lead their employees to new heights; a manual for anyone who strives for originality; and the first-ever; all-access trip into the nerve center of Pixar Animation—into the meetings; postmortems; and “Braintrust” sessions where some of the most successful films in history are made. It is; at heart; a book about how to build a creative culture—but it is also; as Pixar co-founder and president Ed Catmull writes; “an expression of the ideas that I believe make the best in us possible.” For nearly twenty years; Pixar has dominated the world of animation; producing such beloved films as the Toy Story trilogy; Monsters; Inc.; Finding Nemo; The Incredibles; Up; and WALL-E; which have gone on to set box-office records and garner thirty Academy Awards. The joyousness of the storytelling; the inventive plots; the emotional authenticity: In some ways; Pixar movies are an object lesson in what creativity really is. Here; in this book; Catmull reveals the ideals and techniques that have made Pixar so widely admired—and so profitable.   As a young man; Ed Catmull had a dream: to make the first computer-animated movie. He nurtured that dream as a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah; where many computer science pioneers got their start; and then forged a partnership with George Lucas that led; indirectly; to his founding Pixar with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter in 1986. Nine years later; Toy Story was released; changing animation forever. The essential ingredient in that movie’s success—and in the thirteen movies that followed—was the unique environment that Catmull and his colleagues built at Pixar; based on philosophies that protect the creative process and defy convention; such as:   • Give a good idea to a mediocre team; and they will screw it up. But give a mediocre idea to a great team; and they will either fix it or come up with something better. • If you don’t strive to uncover what is unseen and understand its nature; you will be ill prepared to lead.  • It’s not the manager’s job to prevent risks. It’s the manager’s job to make it safe for others to take them. • The cost of preventing errors is often far greater than the cost of fixing them.  • A company’s communication structure should not mirror its organizational structure. Everybody should be able to talk to anybody. • Do not assume that general agreement will lead to change—it takes substantial energy to move a group; even when all are on board.,4.21,68302,4269,business,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077903-creativity-inc

 Blue Ocean Strategy How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make the Competition Irrelevant,W. Chan Kim,"The global phenomenon; embraced by business worldwide and now published in more than 40 languages.This international bestseller challenges everything you thought you knew about the requirements for strategic success.Since the dawn of the industrial age; companies have engaged in head-to-head competition in search of sustained; profitable growth. They have fought for competitive advantage; battled over market share; and struggled for differentiation. Yet; as this influential and immensely popular book shows; these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.In the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy; W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries); the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors; but from creating ""blue oceans""—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves; which the authors call “value innovation;” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.Blue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans.

 Blink The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,Malcolm Gladwell,"Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology and displaying all of the brilliance that made The Tipping Point a classic; Blink changes the way you'll understand every decision you make. Never again will you think about thinking the same way.Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now; in Blink; he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking; about choices that seem to be made in an instant - in the blink of an eye - that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers; while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win; while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work - in the office; in the classroom; in the kitchen; and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last; based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here; too; are great failures of ""blink"": the election of Warren Harding; ""New Coke""; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating; but those who have perfected the art of ""thin-slicing"" - filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.",3.94,501531,15517,business,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40102.Blink

 The Black Swan The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Nassim Nicholas Taleb,A black swan is a highly improbable event with three principal characteristics: It is unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and; after the fact; we concoct an explanation that makes it appear less random; and more predictable; than it was. The astonishing success of Google was a black swan; so was 9/11. For Nassim Nicholas Taleb; black swans underlie almost everything about our world; from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives.Why do we not acknowledge the phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? Part of the answer; according to Taleb; is that humans are hardwired to learn specifics when they should be focused on generalities. We concentrate on things we already know and time and time again fail to take into consideration what we don’t know. We are; therefore; unable to truly estimate opportunities; too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify; narrate; and categorize; and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the “impossible.”For years; Taleb has studied how we fool ourselves into thinking we know more than we actually do. We restrict our thinking to the irrelevant and inconsequential; while large events continue to surprise us and shape our world. Now; in this revelatory book; Taleb explains everything we know about what we don’t know. He offers surprisingly simple tricks for dealing with black swans and benefiting from them.Elegant; startling; and universal in its applications The Black Swan will change the way you look at the world. Taleb is a vastly entertaining writer; with wit; irreverence; and unusual stories to tell. He has a polymathic command of subjects ranging from cognitive science to business to probability theory. The Black Swan is a landmark book – itself a black swan.The book also contains a 4-page glossary; 19 pages of notes; and; a 28-page bibliography in addition to an index.,3.94,88645,5341,business,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/242472.The_Black_Swan
 Principles Life and Work,Ray Dalio,Ray Dalio; one of the world’s most successful investors and entrepreneurs; shares the unconventional principles that he’s developed; refined; and used over the past forty years to create unique results in both life and business—and which any person or organization can adopt to help achieve their goals.In 1975; Ray Dalio founded an investment firm; Bridgewater Associates; out of his two-bedroom apartment in New York City. Forty years later; Bridgewater has made more money for its clients than any other hedge fund in history and grown into the fifth most important private company in the United States; according to Fortune magazine. Dalio himself has been named to Time magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people in the world. Along the way; Dalio discovered a set of unique principles that have led to Bridgewater’s exceptionally effective culture; which he describes as “an idea meritocracy that strives to achieve meaningful work and meaningful relationships through radical transparency.” It is these principles; and not anything special about Dalio—who grew up an ordinary kid in a middle-class Long Island neighborhood—that he believes are the reason behind his success.In Principles; Dalio shares what he’s learned over the course of his remarkable career. He argues that life; management; economics; and investing can all be systemized into rules and understood like machines.

While the book brims with novel ideas for organizations and institutions; Principles also offers a clear; straightforward approach to decision-making that Dalio believes anyone can apply; no matter what they’re seeking to achieve.Here is a rare opportunity to gain proven advice unlike anything you’ll find in the conventional business press.,4.11,35840,2232,business,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34536488-principles

And will you succeed?Yes! You will indeed!(98 and ¾ percent guaranteed.)

A modern classic; Oh; the Places You'll Go! was first published one year before Dr. Seuss's death at the age of eighty-seven.

 How the Grinch Stole Christmas,Dr. Seuss,"""The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season!Now; please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.""Dr. Seuss's small-hearted Grinch ranks right up there with Scrooge when it comes to the crankiest; scowling holiday grumps of all time. For 53 years; the Grinch has lived in a cave on the side of a mountain; looming above the Whos in Whoville. The noisy holiday preparations and infernal singing of the happy little citizens below annoy him to no end. The Grinch decides this frivolous merriment must stop. His ""wonderful; awful"" idea is to don a Santa outfit; strap heavy antlers on his poor; quivering dog Max; construct a makeshift sleigh; head down to Whoville; and strip the chafingly cheerful Whos of their Yuletide glee once and for all.Looking quite out of place and very disturbing in his makeshift Santa get-up; the Grinch slithers down chimneys with empty bags and stealing the Whos' presents; their food; even the logs from their humble Who-fires. He takes the ramshackle sleigh to Mt. Crumpit to dump it and waits to hear the sobs of the Whos when they wake up and discover the trappings of Christmas have disappeared. Imagine the Whos' dismay when they discover the evil-doings of Grinch in his anti-Santa guise. But what is that sound? It's not sobbing; but singing! Children simultaneously adore and fear this triumphant; twisted Seussian testimonial to the undaunted cheerfulness of the Whos; the transcendent nature of joy; and of course; the growth potential of a heart that's two sizes too small. This holiday classic is perfect for reading aloud to your favorite little Whos.",4.35,342246,3522,children-s,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/113946.How_the_Grinch_Stole_Christmas_

 The Reason for God Belief in an Age of Skepticism,Timothy J. Keller,Making Sense of God: An Invitation to the Skeptical; is a prequel to The Reason for God: Belief in an Age of Skepticism. The End of Faith. The God Delusion. God Is Not Great. Letter to a Christian Nation. Bestseller lists are filled with doubters. But what happens when you actually doubt your doubts?Although a vocal minority continues to attack the Christian faith; for most Americans; faith is a large part of their lives: 86 percent of Americans refer to themselves as religious; and 75 percent of all Americans consider themselves Christians. So how should they respond to these passionate; learned; and persuasive books that promote science and secularism over religion and faith? For years; Tim Keller has compiled a list of the most frequently voiced “doubts” skeptics bring to his Manhattan church. And in The Reason for God; he single-handedly dismantles each of them. Written with atheists; agnostics; and skeptics in mind; Keller also provides an intelligent platform on which true believers can stand their ground when bombarded by the backlash. The Reason for God challenges such ideology at its core and points to the true path and purpose of Christianity.Why is there suffering in the world? How could a loving God send people to Hell? Why isn’t Christianity more inclusive? Shouldn’t the Christian God be a god of love? How can one religion be “right” and the rest “wrong”? Why have so many wars been fought in the name of God? These are just a few of the questions even ardent believers wrestle with today. In this book; Tim Keller uses literature; philosophy; real-life conversations and reasoning; and even pop culture to explain how faith in a Christian God is a soundly rational belief; held by thoughtful people of intellectual integrity with a deep compassion for those who truly want to know the truth.,4.18,52949,2214,christian,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1858013.The_Reason_for_God

 Radical Taking Back Your Faith from the American Dream,David Platt,"WHAT IS JESUS WORTH TO YOU?

It's easy for American Christians to forget how Jesus said his followers would actually live; what their new lifestyle would actually look like. They would; he said; leave behind security; money; convenience; even family for him. They would abandon everything for the gospel. They would take up their crosses daily...BUT WHO DO YOU KNOW WHO LIVES LIKE THAT? DO YOU?In Radical; David Platt challenges you to consider with an open heart how we have manipulated the gospel to fit our cultural preferences. He shows what Jesus actually said about being his disciple--then invites you to believe and obey what you have heard. And he tells the dramatic story of what is happening as a ""successful"" suburban church decides to get serious about the gospel according to Jesus.Finally; he urges you to join in The Radical Experiment -- a one-year journey in authentic discipleship that will transform how you live in a world that desperately needs the Good News Jesus came to bring.",4.18,51805,2023,christian,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7497897-radical

 A Grief Observed,C.S. Lewis,"Written with love; humility; and faith; this brief but poignant volume was first published in 1961 and concerns the death of C. S. Lewis's wife; the American-born poet Joy Davidman. In her introduction to this new edition; Madeleine L'Engle writes: ""I am grateful to Lewis for having the courage to yell; to doubt; to kick at God in angry violence. This is a part of a healthy grief which is not often encouraged. It is helpful indeed that C. S. Lewis; who has been such a successful apologist for Christianity; should have the courage to admit doubt about what he has so superbly proclaimed. It gives us permission to admit our own doubts; our own angers and anguishes; and to know that they are part of the soul's growth.""Written in longhand in notebooks that Lewis found in his home; A Grief Observed probes the ""mad midnight moments"" of Lewis's mourning and loss; moments in which he questioned what he had previously believed about life and death; marriage; and even God. Indecision and self-pity assailed Lewis. ""We are under the harrow and can't escape;"" he writes. ""I know that the thing I want is exactly the thing I can never get. The old life; the jokes; the drinks; the arguments; the lovemaking; the tiny; heartbreaking commonplace."" Writing A Grief Observed as ""a defense against total collapse; a safety valve;"" he came to recognize that ""bereavement is a universal and integral part of our experience of love.""Lewis writes his statement of faith with precision; humor; and grace. Yet neither is Lewis reluctant to confess his continuing doubts and his awareness of his own human frailty. This is precisely the quality which suggests that A Grief Observed may become ""among the great devotional books of our age.""",4.19,59812,3332,christian,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26077627-a-grief-observed
 Knowing God,J.I. Packer,For over 40 years; J. I. Packer's classic has been an important tool to help Christians around the world discover the wonder; the glory and the joy of knowing God. In 2006; Christianity Today voted this title one of the top 50 books that have shaped evangelicals. This edition is updated with Americanized language and spelling and a new preface by the author. Stemming from Packer's profound theological knowledge; Knowing God brings together two important facets of the Christian faith: 1. Knowing about God and 2. Knowing God through the context of a close relationship with the person of Jesus Christ. Written in an engaging and practical tone; this thought-provoking work seeks to transform and enrich the Christian understanding of God. Explaining both who God is and how we can relate to him; Packer divides his book into three sections: The first directs our attention to how and why we know God; the second to the attributes of God and the third to the benefits enjoyed by a those who know him intimately. This guide leads readers into a greater understanding of God while providing advice to gaining a closer relationship with him as a result.,4.29,46567,1163,christian,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/139855.Knowing_God

 Captivating Unveiling the Mystery of a Womans Soul,John Eldredge,"Every woman was once a little girl. And every little girl holds in her heart her most precious dreams. She longs to be swept up into a romance; to play an irreplaceable role in a great adventure; to"" be"" the Beauty of the story. And yet―how many women do you know who ever find that life?Most women think they have to settle for a life of efficiency and duty; striving to be the women they ""ought"" to be but often feeling they have failed. Sadly; too many messages for Christian women add to the pressure. ""Do these ten things; and you will be a godly woman."" The effect has not been good on the feminine soul.The message of ""Captivating"" is this: Your heart matters more than anything else in all creation. The desires you had as a little girl and the longings you still feel are telling you of the life God created you to live. He offers to rescue your heart and release you to live as a fully alive and feminine woman. A woman who is truly captivating.",3.91,69654,2165,christian,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11413.Captivating

 A Voice in the Wind,Francine Rivers,“The city was silently bloating in the hot sun; rotting like the thousands of bodies that lay where they had fallen in street battles.” With this opening sentence; A Voice in the Wind transports readers back to Jerusalem during the first Jewish-Roman War; some seventy years after the death of Christ. Following the prides and passions of a group of Jews; Romans and Barbarians living at the time of the siege; the narrative is centered on an ill-fated romance between a steadfast slave girl; Hadassah; and Marcus; the brother of her owner and a handsome aristocrat. After surviving the massacre of her family and the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans; Hadassah is captured and sold to a well-to-do merchant’s family. Brought to Rome; she is pressed into service as a personal slave to hedonistic Julia Valerian. Hadassah struggles to walk in the footsteps of Jesus and to treat her masters in a manner in keeping with His teachings; but she is forced to keep her religious identity a secret in order to survive. Confused and alone; she has only her faith to cling to as she tries to subtly bring God into the lives of her captors. Reckless; impulsive; and villainous; Julia tries to undermine Hadassah at every turn. But Julia’s brother; Marcus; is a different sort altogether. Is it possible for a love between Hadassah and Marcus to flourish considering not only their differing stations in life; but also the gap between Hadassah’s unrelenting faith and Marcus’ lack of belief in anything? Simultaneously; Atretes; a captured soldier from Germania; is forced to become a gladiator. This is the time of Rome’s decline and the decadence of a civilization on the verge of self-destruction serves as a powerful backdrop to the Barbarian’s struggle for survival in the arena.,4.56,76353,3485,christian,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95617.A_Voice_in_the_Wind
 Wild at Heart Revised and Updated Discovering the Secret of a Mans Soul,John Eldredge,"God designed men to be dangerous; says John Eldredge. Simply look at the dreams and desires written in the heart of every boy: To be a hero; to be a warrior; to live a life of adventure and risk. Sadly; most men abandon those dreams and desires-aided by a Christianity that feels like nothing more than pressure to be a ""nice guy."" It is no wonder that many men avoid church; and those who go are often passive and bored to death. In this provocative book; Eldredge gives women a look inside the true heart of a man and gives men permission to be what God designed them to be-dangerous; passionate; alive; and free!",3.92,69370,2109,christian,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40881942-wild-at-heart-revised-and-updated
 The Cost of Discipleship,Dietrich Bonhoeffer,"One of the most important theologians of the twentieth century illuminates the relationship between ourselves and the teachings of Jesus in this classic text on ethics; humanism; and civic duty.What can the call to discipleship; the adherence to the word of Jesus; mean today to the businessman; the soldier; the laborer; or the aristocrat? What did Jesus mean to say to us? What is his will for us today? Drawing on the Sermon on the Mount; Dietrich Bonhoeffer answers these timeless questions by providing a seminal reading of the dichotomy between ""cheap grace"" and ""costly grace."" ""Cheap grace;"" Bonhoeffer wrote; ""is the grace we bestow on ourselves...grace without discipleship....Costly grace is the gospel which must be sought again and again; the girl which must be asked for; the door at which a man must know....It is costly because it costs a man his life; and it is grace because it gives a man the only true life.""The Cost of Discipleship is a compelling statement of the demands of sacrifice and ethical consistency from a man whose life and thought were exemplary articulations of a new type of leadership inspired by the Gospel; and imbued with the spirit of Christian humanism and a creative sense of civic duty.",4.28,36045,1192,christian,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174834.The_Cost_of_Discipleship
 Forgotten God Reversing Our Tragic Neglect of the Holy Spirit,Francis Chan,In the name of the Father; the Son; and ... the Holy Spirit. We pray in the name of all three; but how often do we live with an awareness of only the first two? As Jesus ascended into heaven; He promised to send the Holy Spirit—the Helper—so that we could be true and living witnesses for Christ. Unfortunately; today's church has admired the gift but neglected to open it.Breakthrough author Francis Chan rips away paper and bows to get at the true source of the church's power—the Holy Spirit. Chan contends that we've ignored the Spirit for far too long; and we are reaping the disastrous results. Thorough scriptural support and compelling narrative form Chan's invitation to stop and remember the One we've forgotten; the Spirit of the living God.,4.10,41280,1409,christian,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6515834-forgotten-god
 Surprised by Joy The Shape of My Early Life,C.S. Lewis,"Surprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Life is a partial autobiography describing Lewis' conversion to Christianity. The book overall contains less detail concerning specific events than typical autobiographies. This is because his purpose in writing wasn't primarily historical. His aim was to identify & describe the events surrounding his accidental discovery of & consequent search for the phenomenon he labelled ""Joy"". This word was the best translation he could make of the German idea of Sehnsucht; longing. That isn't to say the book is devoid of information about his life. He recounts his early years with a measure of amusement sometimes mixed with pain. However; while he does describe his life; the principal theme of the book is Joy as he defined it. This Joy was a longing so intense for something so good & so high up it couldn't be explained with words. He's struck with ""stabs of joy"" throughout life. He finally finds what it's for at the end. He writes about his experiences at Malvern College in 1913; aged 15. Though he described the school as ""a very furnace of impure loves"" he defended the practice as being ""the only chink left thru which something spontaneous & uncalculating could creep in."" The book's last two chapters cover the end of his search as he moves from atheism to theism & then from theism to Christianity. He ultimately discovers the true nature & purpose of Joy & its place in his own life. The book isn't connected with his unexpected marriage in later life to Joy Gresham. The marriage occurred long after the period described; though not long after the book was published. His friends were quick to notice the coincidence; remarking he'd really been ""Surprised by Joy"". ""Surprised by Joy"" is also an allusion to Wordsworth's poem; ""Surprised by Joy-Impatient As The Wind""; relating an incident when Wordsworth forgot the death of his beloved daughter.",4.05,52695,1774,christian,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/121732.Surprised_by_Joy

Now; in The Prodigal God; he uses one of the best-known Christian parables to reveal an unexpected message of hope and salvation.Taking his trademark intellectual approach to understanding Christianity; Keller uncovers the essential message of Jesus; locked inside his most familiar parable.

This book will challenge both the devout and skeptics to see Christianity in a whole new way.Look out for Timothy Keller's latest book; The Songs of Jesus; coming from Viking on November 10; 2015.",4.40,32411,1823,christian,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3116205-the-prodigal-god

 Dont Waste Your Life,John Piper,"John Piper writes; ""I will tell you what a tragedy is. I will show you how to waste your life. Consider this story from the February 1998 Reader's Digest: A couple 'took early retirement from their jobs in the Northeast five years ago when he was 59 and she was 51. Now they live in Punta Gorda; Florida; where they cruise on their 30-foot trawler; play softball and collect shells. . . .' Picture them before Christ at the great day of judgment: 'Look; Lord. See my shells.' That is a tragedy.""God created us to live with a single passion to joyfully display his supreme excellence in all the spheres of life. The wasted life is the life without this passion. God calls us to pray and think and dream and plan and work not to be made much of; but to make much of him in every part of our lives.""Most people slip by in life without a passion for God; spending their lives on trivial diversions; living for comfort and pleasure; and perhaps trying to avoid sin. This book will warn you not to get caught up in a life that counts for nothing. It will challenge you to live and die boasting in the cross of Christ and making the glory of God your singular passion. If you believe that to live is Christ and to die is gain; read this book; learn to live for Christ; and don't waste your life!",4.12,26935,801,christian,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/347656.Don_t_Waste_Your_Life
 The Meaning of Marriage Facing the Complexities of Commitment with the Wisdom of God,Timothy J. Keller,Renowned pastor of New York’s Redeemer Presbyterian Church and author of The Songs of Jesus; Timothy Keller with his wife of 36 years; delivers The Meaning of Marriage; an extraordinarily insightful look at the keys to happiness in marriage that will inspire Christians; skeptics; singles; long-time married couples; and those about to be engaged.Modern culture would make you believe that everyone has a soul-mate; that romance is the most important part of a successful marriage; that your spouse is there to help you realize your potential; that marriage does not mean forever; but merely for now; that starting over after a divorce is the best solution to seemingly intractable marriage issues. All those modern-day assumptions are; in a word; wrong.Using the Bible as his guide; coupled with insightful commentary from his wife of thirty-six years; Kathy; Timothy Keller shows that God created marriage to bring us closer to him and to bring us more joy in our lives. It is a glorious relationship that is also the most misunderstood and mysterious. With a clear-eyed understanding of the Bible; and meaningful instruction on how to have a successful marriage; The Meaning of Marriage is essential reading for anyone who wants to know God and love more deeply in this life.,4.48,23601,1601,christian,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11389341-the-meaning-of-marriage

 The Practice of the Presence of God,Brother Lawrence,Brother Lawrence was a man of humble beginnings who discovered the greatest secret of living in the kingdom of God here on earth. It is the art of “practicing the presence of God in one single act that does not end.” He often stated that it is God who paints Himself in the depths of our souls. We must merely open our hearts to receive Him and His loving presence. As a humble cook; Brother Lawrence learned an important lesson through each daily chore: The time he spent in communion with the Lord should be the same; whether he was bustling around in the kitchen—with several people asking questions at the same time—or on his knees in prayer. He learned to cultivate the deep presence of God so thoroughly in his own heart that he was able to joyfully exclaim; “I am doing now what I will do for all eternity. I am blessing God; praising Him; adoring Him; and loving Him with all my heart.” This unparalleled classic has given both blessing and instruction to those who can be content with nothing less than knowing God in all His majesty and feeling His loving presence throughout each simple day.,4.29,38764,1172,christian,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/498641.The_Practice_of_the_Presence_of_God
 Whats So Amazing About Grace,Philip Yancey,Original Cover Edition for ISBN 0310245656In 1987; an IRA bomb buried Gordon Wilson and his twenty-year-old daughter beneath five feet of rubble. Gordon alone survived. And forgave. He said of the bombers; ' I have lost my daughter; but I bear no grudge . . . I shall pray; tonight and every night; that God will forgive them.' His words caught the media's ears  and out of one man's grief; the world got a glimpse of grace. Grace is the church's great distinctive. It's the one thing the world cannot duplicate; and the one thing it craves above all else  for only grace can bring hope and transformation to a jaded world. In What's So Amazing About Grace? award-winning author Philip Yancey explores grace at street level. If grace is God's love for the undeserving; he asks; then what does it look like in action? And if Christians are its sole dispensers; then how are we doing at lavishing grace on a world that knows far more of cruelty and unforgiveness than it does of mercy? Yancey sets grace in the midst of life's stark images; tests its mettle against horrific 'ungrace.' Can grace survive in the midst of such atrocities as the Nazi holocaust? Can it triumph over the brutality of the Ku Klux Klan? Should any grace at all be shown to the likes of Jeffrey Dahmer; who killed and cannibalized seventeen young men? Grace does not excuse sin; says Yancey; but it treasures the sinner. True grace is shocking; scandalous. It shakes our conventions with its insistence on getting close to sinners and touching them with mercy and hope. It forgives the unfaithful spouse; the racist; the child abuser. It loves today's AIDS-ridden addict as much as the tax collector of Jesus' day. In his most personal and provocative book ever; Yancey offers compelling; true portraits of grace's life-changing power. He searches for its presence in his own life and in the church. He asks; How can Christians contend graciously with moral issues that threaten all they hold dear? And he challenges us to become living answers to a world that desperately wants to know; What's So Amazing About Grace?,4.16,38311,1066,christian,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53817.What_s_So_Amazing_About_Grace_

 1984,George Orwell,Among the seminal texts of the 20th century; Nineteen Eighty-Four is a rare work that grows more haunting as its futuristic purgatory becomes more real. Published in 1949; the book offers political satirist George Orwell's nightmarish vision of a totalitarian; bureaucratic world and one poor stiff's attempt to find individuality. The brilliance of the novel is Orwell's prescience of modern life—the ubiquity of television; the distortion of the language—and his ability to construct such a thorough version of hell. Required reading for students since it was published; it ranks among the most terrifying novels ever written.,4.19,3262355,72674,classics,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40961427-1984

 The Catcher in the Rye,J.D. Salinger,The hero-narrator of The Catcher in the Rye is an ancient child of sixteen; a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult; secondhand description; he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but; almost; hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices; adult voices; underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular; yet remaining marvelously faithful to it; he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However; like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders; he keeps most of the pain to; and for; himself. The pleasure he gives away; or sets aside; with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep. J.D. Salinger's classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951. The novel was included on Time's 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. It was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It has been frequently challenged in the court for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality and in the 1950's and 60's it was the novel that every teenage boy wants to read.,3.81,2806047,58838,classics,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5107.The_Catcher_in_the_Rye

They attempt to forge their own society; failing; however; in the face of terror; sin and evil. And as order collapses; as strange howls echo in the night; as terror begins its reign; the hope of adventure seems as far from reality as the hope of being rescued.

Tom lives with his Aunt Polly; half-brother Sid; and cousin Mary in the quaint town of St. Petersburg; just off the shore of the Mississippi River. St. Petersburg is described as a typical small-town atmosphere where the Christian faith is predominant; the social network is close-knit; and familiarity resides.  Unlike his brother Sid; Tom receives ""lickings"" from his Aunt Polly; ever the mischief-maker; would rather play hooky than attend school and often sneaks out his bedroom window at night to adventure with his friend; Huckleberry Finn ­ the town's social outcast. Tom; despite his dread of schooling; is extremely clever and would normally get away with his pranks if Sid were not such a ""tattle-tale.""  As punishment for skipping school to go swimming; Aunt Polly assigns Tom the chore of whitewashing the fence surrounding the house. In a brilliant scheme; Tom is able to con the neighborhood boys into completing the chore for him; managing to convince them of the joys of whitewashing. At school; Tom is equally as flamboyant; and attracts attention by chasing other boys; yelling; and running around.

But their romance collapses when she learns Tom has been ""engaged"" previously to Amy Lawrence. Shortly after Becky shuns him; he accompanies Huckleberry Finn to the graveyard at night; where they witness the murder of Dr. Robinson.Excerpt:""TOM!"" No answer. ""TOM!"" No answer. ""What's gone with that boy;  I wonder? You TOM!"" No answer. The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or never looked through them for so small a thing as a boy; they were her state pair; the pride of her heart; and were built for ""style;"" not service—she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well. She looked perplexed for a moment; and then said; not fiercely; but still loud enough for the furniture to hear: ""Well; I lay if I get hold of you I'll—"" She did not finish; for by this time she was bending down and punching under the bed with the broom; and so she needed breath to punctuate the punches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat. ""I never did see the beat of that boy!""",3.91,776764,10271,classics,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583.The_Adventures_of_Tom_Sawyer

 The Diary of a Young Girl,Anne Frank,Discovered in the attic in which she spent the last years of her life; Anne Frank’s remarkable diary has become a world classic—a powerful reminder of the horrors of war and an eloquent testament to the human spirit. In 1942; with the Nazis occupying Holland; a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years; until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo; the Franks and another family lived cloistered in the “Secret Annexe” of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world; they faced hunger; boredom; the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters; and the ever-present threat of discovery and death.

 The Grapes of Wrath,John Steinbeck,The Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression; a book that galvanized—and sometimes outraged—millions of readers.First published in 1939; Steinbeck’s Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression chronicles the Dust Bowl migration of the 1930s and tells the story of one Oklahoma farm family; the Joads—driven from their homestead and forced to travel west to the promised land of California. Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision; elemental yet plainspoken; tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity.

 The Way of Kings,Brandon Sanderson,From #1 New York Times bestselling author Brandon Sanderson; The Way of Kings; book one of The Stormlight Archive begins an incredible new saga of epic proportion.Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells; trees pull in branches; and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant; but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them; and won by them.One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There; Kaladin; who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother; has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense; where ten armies fight separately against a single foe; he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother; the late king; he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant; he has begun to doubt his own sanity.Across the ocean; an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic; Dalinar's niece; Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning; Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft; her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.The result of over ten years of planning; writing; and world-building; The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive; a bold masterpiece in the making.Speak again the ancient oaths:Life before death.Strength before weakness.Journey before Destination.and return to men the Shards they once bore.The Knights Radiant must stand again.,4.62,321218,21188,ebooks,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7235533-the-way-of-kings
 The Ocean at the End of the Lane,Neil Gaiman,Sussex; England. A middle-aged man returns to his childhood home to attend a funeral. Although the house he lived in is long gone; he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road; where; when he was seven; he encountered a most remarkable girl; Lettie Hempstock; and her mother and grandmother. He hasn't thought of Lettie in decades; and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse; the unremembered past comes flooding back. And it is a past too strange; too frightening; too dangerous to have happened to anyone; let alone a small boy.Forty years earlier; a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road. Like a fuse on a firework; his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways. The darkness was unleashed; something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy. And Lettie—magical; comforting; wise beyond her years—promised to protect him; no matter what.A groundbreaking work from a master; The Ocean at the End of the Lane is told with a rare understanding of all that makes us human; and shows the power of stories to reveal and shelter us from the darkness inside and out. It is a stirring; terrifying; and elegiac fable as delicate as a butterfly's wing and as menacing as a knife in the dark.,4.00,495002,48654,ebooks,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15783514-the-ocean-at-the-end-of-the-lane

 1984,George Orwell,Among the seminal texts of the 20th century; Nineteen Eighty-Four is a rare work that grows more haunting as its futuristic purgatory becomes more real. Published in 1949; the book offers political satirist George Orwell's nightmarish vision of a totalitarian; bureaucratic world and one poor stiff's attempt to find individuality.

Required reading for students since it was published; it ranks among the most terrifying novels ever written.,4.19,3262355,72674,fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40961427-1984

 The Catcher in the Rye,J.D. Salinger,The hero-narrator of The Catcher in the Rye is an ancient child of sixteen; a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult; secondhand description; he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but; almost; hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices; adult voices; underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular; yet remaining marvelously faithful to it; he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However; like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders; he keeps most of the pain to; and for; himself. The pleasure he gives away; or sets aside; with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep. J.D. Salinger's classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951. The novel was included on Time's 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. It was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.

 Maus II A Survivors Tale And Here My Troubles Began,Art Spiegelman,Acclaimed as a quiet triumph and a brutally moving work of art; the first volume of Art Spieglman's Maus introduced readers to Vladek Spiegleman; a Jewish survivor of Hitler's Europe; and his son; a cartoonist trying to come to terms with his father; his father's terrifying story; and History itself. Its form; the cartoon (the Nazis are cats; the Jews mice); succeeds perfectly in shocking us out of any lingering sense of familiararity with the events described; approaching; as it does; the unspeakable through the diminutive.This second volume; subtitled And Here My Troubles Began; moves us from the barracks of Auschwitz to the bungalows of the Catskills. Genuinely tragic and comic by turns; it attains a complexity of theme and a precision of thought new to comics and rare in any medium. Maus ties together two powerful stories: Vladek's harrowing tale of survival against all odds; delineating the paradox of daily life in the death camps; and the author's account of his tortured relationship with his aging father. At every level this is the ultimate survivor's tale - and that too of the children who somehow survive even the survivors.,4.37,123329,3085,fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15197.Maus_II

 The Underground Railroad,Colson Whitehead,Cora is a slave on a cotton plantation in Georgia. Life is hell for all the slaves; but especially bad for Cora; an outcast even among her fellow Africans; she is coming into womanhood—where even greater pain awaits. When Caesar; a recent arrival from Virginia; tells her about the Underground Railroad; they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape. Matters do not go as planned—Cora kills a young white boy who tries to capture her. Though they manage to find a station and head north; they are being hunted.In Whitehead’s ingenious conception; the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor—engineers and conductors operate a secret network of tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora and Caesar’s first stop is South Carolina; in a city that initially seems like a haven. But the city’s placid surface masks an insidious scheme designed for its black denizens. And even worse: Ridgeway; the relentless slave catcher; is close on their heels. Forced to flee again; Cora embarks on a harrowing flight; state by state; seeking true freedom.Like the protagonist of Gulliver’s Travels; Cora encounters different worlds at each stage of her journey—hers is an odyssey through time as well as space. As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the unique terrors for black people in the pre–Civil War era; his narrative seamlessly weaves the saga of America from the brutal importation of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. The Underground Railroad is at once a kinetic adventure tale of one woman’s ferocious will to escape the horrors of bondage and a shattering; powerful meditation on the history we all share.,4.03,303036,25438,graphic-novels,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30555488-the-underground-railroad

 The Paris Wife,Paula McLain,A deeply evocative story of ambition and betrayal; The Paris Wife captures a remarkable period of time and a love affair between two unforgettable people: Ernest Hemingway and his wife Hadley. Chicago; 1920: Hadley Richardson is a quiet twenty-eight-year-old who has all but given up on love and happiness—until she meets Ernest Hemingway and her life changes forever. Following a whirlwind courtship and wedding; the pair set sail for Paris; where they become the golden couple in a lively and volatile group—the fabled “Lost Generation”—that includes Gertrude Stein; Ezra Pound; and F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. Though deeply in love; the Hemingways are ill prepared for the hard-drinking and fast-living life of Jazz Age Paris; which hardly values traditional notions of family and monogamy. Surrounded by beautiful women and competing egos; Ernest struggles to find the voice that will earn him a place in history; pouring all the richness and intensity of his life with Hadley and their circle of friends into the novel that will become The Sun Also Rises. Hadley; meanwhile; strives to hold on to her sense of self as the demands of life with Ernest grow costly and her roles as wife; friend; and muse become more challenging. Despite their extraordinary bond; they eventually find themselves facing the ultimate crisis of their marriage—a deception that will lead to the unraveling of everything they’ve fought so hard for. A heartbreaking portrayal of love and torn loyalty; The Paris Wife is all the more poignant because we know that; in the end; Hemingway wrote that he would rather have died than fallen in love with anyone but Hadley.,3.81,272022,21211,graphic-novels,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8683812-the-paris-wife

 Sapiens A Brief History of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari,100;000 years ago; at least six human species inhabited the earth. Today there is just one. Us. Homo sapiens. How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods; nations and human rights; to trust money; books and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy; timetables and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? In Sapiens; Dr Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history; from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical – and sometimes devastating – breakthroughs of the Cognitive; Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology; anthropology; paleontology and economics; he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies; the animals and plants around us; and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors? And what; if anything; can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come?

 The Devil in the White City Murder; Magic; and Madness at the Fair That Changed America,Erik Larson,"Author Erik Larson imbues the incredible events surrounding the 1893 Chicago World's Fair with such drama that readers may find themselves checking the book's categorization to be sure that 'The Devil in the White City' is not; in fact; a highly imaginative novel. Larson tells the stories of two men: Daniel H. Burnham; the architect responsible for the fair's construction; and H.H. Holmes; a serial killer masquerading as a charming doctor. Burnham's challenge was immense. In a short period of time; he was forced to overcome the death of his partner and numerous other obstacles to construct the famous ""White City"" around which the fair was built. His efforts to complete the project; and the fair's incredible success; are skillfully related along with entertaining appearances by such notables as Buffalo Bill Cody; Susan B. Anthony; and Thomas Edison. The activities of the sinister Dr. Holmes; who is believed to be responsible for scores of murders around the time of the fair; are equally remarkable. He devised and erected the World's Fair Hotel; complete with crematorium and gas chamber; near the fairgrounds and used the event as well as his own charismatic personality to lure victims. Combining the stories of an architect and a killer in one book; mostly in alternating chapters; seems like an odd choice but it works. The magical appeal and horrifying dark side of 19th-century Chicago are both revealed through Larson's skillful writing. - John Moe",3.99,541411,33309,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/397483.The_Devil_in_the_White_City
 The Diary of a Young Girl,Anne Frank,Discovered in the attic in which she spent the last years of her life; Anne Frank’s remarkable diary has become a world classic—a powerful reminder of the horrors of war and an eloquent testament to the human spirit. In 1942; with the Nazis occupying Holland; a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years; until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo; the Franks and another family lived cloistered in the “Secret Annexe” of an old office building.

 1776,David McCullough,In this masterful book; David McCullough tells the intensely human story of those who marched with General George Washington in the year of the Declaration of Independence - when the whole American cause was riding on their success; without which all hope for independence would have been dashed and the noble ideals of the Declaration would have amounted to little more than words on paper.Based on extensive research in both American and British archives; 1776 is a powerful drama written with extraordinary narrative vitality. It is the story of Americans in the ranks; men of every shape; size; and color; farmers; schoolteachers; shoemakers; no-accounts; and mere boys turned soldiers. And it is the story of the King's men; the British commander; William Howe; an his highly disciplined redcoats who looked on their rebel foes with contempt and fought with a valor too little known.At the center of the drama; with Washington; are two young American patriots; who; at first; knew no more of war than what they had read in books - Nathaniel Green; a Quaker who was made a general at thirty-three; and Henry Knox; a twenty-five-year-old bookseller who had the preposterous idea of hauling the guns of Fort Ticonderoga overland to Boston in the dead of Winter.But it is the American commander-in-chief who stands foremost - Washington; who had never before led an army in battle. Written as a companion work to his celebrated biography of John Adams; David McCullough's 1776 is another landmark in the literature of American history.,4.07,193191,7381,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1067.1776
 A Short History of Nearly Everything,Bill Bryson,In Bryson's biggest book; he confronts his greatest challenge: to understand—and; if possible; answer—the oldest; biggest questions we have posed about the universe and ourselves. Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization; Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end; he has attached himself to a host of the world’s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists; anthropologists; and mathematicians; travelling to their offices; laboratories; and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books; pestered them with questions; apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. A Short History of Nearly Everything is the record of this quest; and it is a sometimes profound; sometimes funny; and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge; as only Bill Bryson can render it. Science has never been more involving or entertaining.,4.19,310139,12677,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21.A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything
 The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich A History of Nazi Germany,William L. Shirer,Hitler boasted that The Third Reich would last a thousand years. It lasted only 12. But those 12 years contained some of the most catastrophic events Western civilization has ever known.No other powerful empire ever bequeathed such mountains of evidence about its birth and destruction as the Third Reich. When the bitter war was over; and before the Nazis could destroy their files; the Allied demand for unconditional surrender produced an almost hour-by-hour record of the nightmare empire built by Adolph Hitler. This record included the testimony of Nazi leaders and of concentration camp inmates; the diaries of officials; transcripts of secret conferences; army orders; private letters—all the vast paperwork behind Hitler's drive to conquer the world.The famed foreign correspondent and historian William L. Shirer; who had watched and reported on the Nazis since 1925; spent five and a half years sifting through this massive documentation. The result is a monumental study that has been widely acclaimed as the definitive record of one of the most frightening chapters in the history of mankind.This worldwide bestseller has been acclaimed as the definitive book on Nazi Germany; it is a classic work.The accounts of how the United States got involved and how Hitler used Mussolini and Japan are astonishing; and the coverage of the war-from Germany's early successes to her eventual defeat-is must reading,4.16,105108,3000,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/767171.The_Rise_and_Fall_of_the_Third_Reich
 1491 New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus,Charles C. Mann,In this groundbreaking work of science; history; and archaeology; Charles C. Mann radically alters our understanding of the Americas before the arrival of Columbus in 1492.Contrary to what so many Americans learn in school; the pre-Columbian Indians were not sparsely settled in a pristine wilderness; rather; there were huge numbers of Indians who actively molded and influenced the land around them. The astonishing Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had running water and immaculately clean streets; and was larger than any contemporary European city. Mexican cultures created corn in a specialized breeding process that it has been called man’s first feat of genetic engineering. Indeed; Indians were not living lightly on the land but were landscaping and manipulating their world in ways that we are only now beginning to understand. Challenging and surprising; this a transformative new look at a rich and fascinating world we only thought we knew.,4.01,69479,3962,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39020.1491

 Team of Rivals The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,Doris Kearns Goodwin,Winner of the Lincoln PrizeAcclaimed historian Doris Kearns Goodwin illuminates Lincoln's political genius in this highly original work; as the one-term congressman and prairie lawyer rises from obscurity to prevail over three gifted rivals of national reputation to become president.On May 18; 1860; William H. Seward; Salmon P. Chase; Edward Bates; and Abraham Lincoln waited in their hometowns for the results from the Republican National Convention in Chicago. When Lincoln emerged as the victor; his rivals were dismayed and angry.Throughout the turbulent 1850s; each had energetically sought the presidency as the conflict over slavery was leading inexorably to secession and civil war. That Lincoln succeeded; Goodwin demonstrates; was the result of a character that had been forged by experiences that raised him above his more privileged and accomplished rivals. He won because he possessed an extraordinary ability to put himself in the place of other men; to experience what they were feeling; to understand their motives and desires.It was this capacity that enabled Lincoln as president to bring his disgruntled opponents together; create the most unusual cabinet in history; and marshal their talents to the task of preserving the Union and winning the war.We view the long; horrifying struggle from the vantage of the White House as Lincoln copes with incompetent generals; hostile congressmen; and his raucous cabinet. He overcomes these obstacles by winning the respect of his former competitors; and in the case of Seward; finds a loyal and crucial friend to see him through.This brilliant multiple biography is centered on Lincoln's mastery of men and how it shaped the most significant presidency in the nation's history.,4.25,159190,7222,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2199.Team_of_Rivals
 Unbroken A World War II Story of Survival; Resilience and Redemption,Laura Hillenbrand,"
In her long-awaited new book; Laura Hillenbrand writes with the same rich and vivid narrative voice she displayed in Seabiscuit. Telling an unforgettable story of a man's journey into extremity; Unbroken is a testament to the resilience of the human mind; body; and spirit.
On a May afternoon in 1943; an Army Air Forces bomber crashed into the Pacific Ocean and disappeared; leaving only a spray of debris and a slick of oil; gasoline; and blood. Then; on the ocean surface; a face appeared. It was that of a young lieutenant; the plane's bombardier; who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard. So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War.The lieutenant’s name was Louis Zamperini. In boyhood; he'd been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent; breaking into houses; brawling; and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager; he had channeled his defiance into running; discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile. But when war had come; the athlete had become an airman; embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight; a tiny raft; and a drift into the unknown.Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean; leaping sharks; a foundering raft; thirst and starvation; enemy aircraft; and; beyond; a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance; Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope; resolve; and humor; brutality with rebellion. His fate; whether triumph or tragedy; would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will.",4.36,789627,46650,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8664353-unbroken
 John Adams,David McCullough,"The enthralling; often surprising story of John Adams; one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived.In this powerful; epic biography; David McCullough unfolds the adventurous life-journey of John Adams; the brilliant; fiercely independent; often irascible; always honest Yankee patriot -- ""the colossus of independence;"" as Thomas Jefferson called him -- who spared nothing in his zeal for the American Revolution; who rose to become the second President of the United States and saved the country from blundering into an unnecessary war; who was learned beyond all but a few and regarded by some as ""out of his senses""; and whose marriage to the wise and valiant Abigail Adams is one of the moving love stories in American history. Like his masterly; Pulitzer Prize-winning biography Truman; David McCullough's John Adams has the sweep and vitality of a great novel. It is both a riveting portrait of an abundantly human man and a vivid evocation of his time; much of it drawn from an outstanding collection of Adams family letters and diaries. In particular; the more than one thousand surviving letters between John and Abigail Adams; nearly half of which have never been published; provide extraordinary access to their private lives and make it possible to know John Adams as no other major American of his founding era. As he has with stunning effect in his previous books; McCullough tells the story from within -- from the point of view of the amazing eighteenth century and of those who; caught up in events; had no sure way of knowing how things would turn out. George Washington; Benjamin Franklin; John Jay; the British spy Edward Bancroft; Madame Lafayette and Jefferson's Paris ""interest"" Maria Cosway; Alexander Hamilton; James Madison; the scandalmonger James Callender; Sally Hemings; John Marshall; Talleyrand; and Aaron Burr all figure in this panoramic chronicle; as does; importantly; John Quincy Adams; the adored son whom Adams would live to see become President. Crucial to the story; as it was to history; is the relationship between Adams and Jefferson; born opposites -- one a Massachusetts farmer's son; the other a Virginia aristocrat and slaveholder; one short and stout; the other tall and spare. Adams embraced conflict; Jefferson avoided it. Adams had great humor; Jefferson; very little. But they were alike in their devotion to their country. At first they were ardent co-revolutionaries; then fellow diplomats and close friends. With the advent of the two political parties; they became archrivals; even enemies; in the intense struggle for the presidency in 1800; perhaps the most vicious election in history. Then; amazingly; they became friends again; and ultimately; incredibly; they died on the same day -- their day of days -- July 4; in the year 1826. Much about John Adams's life will come as a surprise to many readers. His courageous voyage on the frigate Boston in the winter of 1778 and his later trek over the Pyrenees are exploits that few would have dared and that few readers will ever forget. It is a life encompassing a huge arc -- Adams lived longer than any president. The story ranges from the Boston Massacre to Philadelphia in 1776 to the Versailles of Louis XVI; from Spain to Amsterdam; from the Court of St. James's; where Adams was the first American to stand before King George III as a representative of the new nation; to the raw; half-finished Capital by the Potomac; where Adams was the first President to occupy the White House. This is history on a grand scale -- a book about politics and war and social issues; but also about human nature; love; religious faith; virtue; ambition; friendship and betrayal; and the far-reaching consequences of noble ideas. Above all; John Adams is an enthralling; often surprising story of one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived.",4.05,321677,6418,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2203.John_Adams

 In the Garden of Beasts Love; Terror; and an American Family in Hitlers Berlin,Erik Larson,The time is 1933; the place; Berlin; when William E. Dodd becomes America's first ambassador to Hitler's Germany in a year that proved to be a turning point in history.A mild-mannered professor from Chicago; Dodd brings along his wife; son; and flamboyant daughter; Martha. At first Martha is entranced by the parties and pomp; and the handsome young men of the Third Reich with their infectious enthusiasm for restoring Germany to a position of world prominence. Enamored of the New Germany; she has one affair after another; including with the surprisingly honorable first chief of the Gestapo; Rudolf Diels. But as evidence of Jewish persecution mounts; confirmed by chilling first-person testimony; her father telegraphs his concerns to a largely indifferent State Department back home. Dodd watches with alarm as Jews are attacked; the press is censored; and drafts of frightening new laws begin to circulate. As that first year unfolds and the shadows deepen; the Dodds experience days full of excitement; intrigue; romance and ultimately; horror; when a climactic spasm of violence and murder reveals Hitler's true character and ruthless ambition.Suffused with the tense atmosphere of the period; and with unforgettable portraits of the bizarre Goring and the expectedly charming—yet wholly sinister—Goebbels; In the Garden of Beasts lends a stunning; eyewitness perspective on events as they unfold in real time; revealing an era of surprising nuance and complexity. The result is a dazzling; addictively readable work that speaks volumes about why the world did not recognize the grave threat posed by Hitler until Berlin; and Europe; were awash in blood and terror.,3.84,167953,14877,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9938498-in-the-garden-of-beasts

Chernow’s biography gives Hamilton his due and sets the record straight; deftly illustrating that the political and economic greatness of today’s America is the result of Hamilton’s countless sacrifices to champion ideas that were often wildly disputed during his time. “To repudiate his legacy;” Chernow writes; “is; in many ways; to repudiate the modern world.” Chernow here recounts Hamilton’s turbulent life: an illegitimate; largely self-taught orphan from the Caribbean; he came out of nowhere to take America by storm; rising to become George Washington’s aide-de-camp in the Continental Army; coauthoring The Federalist Papers; founding the Bank of New York; leading the Federalist Party; and becoming the first Treasury Secretary of the United States.Historians have long told the story of America’s birth as the triumph of Jefferson’s democratic ideals over the aristocratic intentions of Hamilton. Chernow presents an entirely different man; whose legendary ambitions were motivated not merely by self-interest but by passionate patriotism and a stubborn will to build the foundations of American prosperity and power. His is a Hamilton far more human than we’ve encountered before—from his shame about his birth to his fiery aspirations; from his intimate relationships with childhood friends to his titanic feuds with Jefferson; Madison; Adams; Monroe; and Burr; and from his highly public affair with Maria Reynolds to his loving marriage to his loyal wife Eliza. And never before has there been a more vivid account of Hamilton’s famous and mysterious death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July of 1804.Chernow’s biography is not just a portrait of Hamilton; but the story of America’s birth seen through its most central figure. At a critical time to look back to our roots; 
Alexander Hamilton
 will remind readers of the purpose of our institutions and our heritage as Americans.",4.20,138172,8461,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16130.Alexander_Hamilton
 Dead Wake The Last Crossing of the Lusitania,Erik Larson,"From the #1 New York Times bestselling author and master of narrative nonfiction comes the enthralling story of the sinking of the LusitaniaOn May 1; 1915; a luxury ocean liner as richly appointed as an English country house sailed out of New York; bound for Liverpool; carrying a record number of children and infants. The passengers were anxious. Germany had declared the seas around Britain to be a war zone; and for months; its U-boats had brought terror to the North Atlantic. But the Lusitania was one of the era's great transatlantic ""Greyhounds"" and her captain; William Thomas Turner; placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from attack. He knew; moreover; that his ship - the fastest then in service - could outrun any threat. Germany; however; was determined to change the rules of the game; and Walther Schwieger; the captain of Unterseeboot-20; was happy to oblige. Meanwhile; an ultra-secret British intelligence unit tracked Schwieger's U-boat; but told no one. As U-20 and the Lusitania made their way toward Liverpool; an array of forces both grand and achingly small - hubris; a chance fog; a closely guarded secret; and more--all converged to produce one of the great disasters of history. It is a story that many of us think we know but don't; and Erik Larson tells it thrillingly; switching between hunter and hunted while painting a larger portrait of America at the height of the Progressive Era. Full of glamour; mystery; and real-life suspense; Dead Wake brings to life a cast of evocative characters; from famed Boston bookseller Charles Lauriat to pioneering female architect Theodate Pope Riddle to President Wilson; a man lost to grief; dreading the widening war but also captivated by the prospect of new love. Gripping and important; Dead Wake captures the sheer drama and emotional power of a disaster that helped place America on the road to war.",4.08,113656,11554,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22551730-dead-wake
 Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World,Jack Weatherford,The name Genghis Khan often conjures the image of a relentless; bloodthirsty barbarian on horseback leading a ruthless band of nomadic warriors in the looting of the civilized world. But the surprising truth is that Genghis Khan was a visionary leader whose conquests joined backward Europe with the flourishing cultures of Asia to trigger a global awakening; an unprecedented explosion of technologies; trade; and ideas. In Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World; Jack Weatherford; the only Western scholar ever to be allowed into the Mongols’ “Great Taboo”—Genghis Khan’s homeland and forbidden burial site—tracks the astonishing story of Genghis Khan and his descendants; and their conquest and transformation of the world. Fighting his way to power on the remote steppes of Mongolia; Genghis Khan developed revolutionary military strategies and weaponry that emphasized rapid attack and siege warfare; which he then brilliantly used to overwhelm opposing armies in Asia; break the back of the Islamic world; and render the armored knights of Europe obsolete. Under Genghis Khan; the Mongol army never numbered more than 100;000 warriors; yet it subjugated more lands and people in twenty-five years than the Romans conquered in four hundred. With an empire that stretched from Siberia to India; from Vietnam to Hungary; and from Korea to the Balkans; the Mongols dramatically redrew the map of the globe; connecting disparate kingdoms into a new world order. But contrary to popular wisdom; Weatherford reveals that the Mongols were not just masters of conquest; but possessed a genius for progressive and benevolent rule. On every level and from any perspective; the scale and scope of Genghis Khan’s accomplishments challenge the limits of imagination. Genghis Khan was an innovative leader; the first ruler in many conquered countries to put the power of law above his own power; encourage religious freedom; create public schools; grant diplomatic immunity; abolish torture; and institute free trade. The trade routes he created became lucrative pathways for commerce; but also for ideas; technologies; and expertise that transformed the way people lived. The Mongols introduced the first international paper currency and postal system and developed and spread revolutionary technologies like printing; the cannon; compass; and abacus. They took local foods and products like lemons; carrots; noodles; tea; rugs; playing cards; and pants and turned them into staples of life around the world. The Mongols were the architects of a new way of life at a pivotal time in history. In Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World; Jack Weatherford resurrects the true history of Genghis Khan; from the story of his relentless rise through Mongol tribal culture to the waging of his devastatingly successful wars and the explosion of civilization that the Mongol Empire unleashed. This dazzling work of revisionist history doesn’t just paint an unprecedented portrait of a great leader and his legacy; but challenges us to reconsider how the modern world was made.From the Hardcover edition.,4.00,56406,2905,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40718726-genghis-khan-and-the-making-of-the-modern-world
 The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,Rebecca Skloot,Her name was Henrietta Lacks; but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors; yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture; they are still alive today; though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale; they’d weigh more than 50 million metric tons—as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer; viruses; and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization; cloning; and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions.Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown; buried in an unmarked grave.Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey; from the “colored” ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta’s small; dying hometown of Clover; Virginia — a land of wooden slave quarters; faith healings; and voodoo — to East Baltimore today; where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells.Henrietta’s family did not learn of her “immortality” until more than twenty years after her death; when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials; her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows; the story of the Lacks family — past and present — is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans; the birth of bioethics; and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.Over the decade it took to uncover this story; Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family—especially Henrietta’s daughter Deborah; who was devastated to learn about her mother’s cells. She was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space? What happened to her sister; Elsie; who died in a mental institution at the age of fifteen? And if her mother was so important to medicine; why couldn’t her children afford health insurance?Intimate in feeling; astonishing in scope; and impossible to put down; The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery; as well as its human consequences.,4.07,604642,35072,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6493208-the-immortal-life-of-henrietta-lacks
 Lies My Teacher Told Me Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong,James W. Loewen,Americans have lost touch with their history; and in Lies My Teacher Told Me Professor James Loewen shows why. After surveying eighteen leading high school American history texts; he has concluded that not one does a decent job of making history interesting or memorable.

From the truth about Columbus's historic voyages to an honest evaluation of our national leaders; Loewen revives our history; restoring the vitality and relevance it truly possesses.Thought provoking; nonpartisan; and often shocking; Loewen unveils the real America in this iconoclastic classic beloved by high school teachers; history buffs; and enlightened citizens across the country.,3.95,58099,3002,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/296662.Lies_My_Teacher_Told_Me
 The Professor and the Madman A Tale of Murder; Insanity and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary,Simon Winchester,The Professor and the Madman; masterfully researched and eloquently written; is an extraordinary tale of madness; genius; and the incredible obsessions of two remarkable men that led to the making of the Oxford English Dictionary -- and literary history. The compilation of the OED; begun in 1857; was one of the most ambitious projects ever undertaken. As definitions were collected; the overseeing committee; led by Professor James Murray; discovered that one man; Dr. W. C. Minor; had submitted more than ten thousand.

 A Distant Mirror The Calamitous 14th Century,Barbara W. Tuchman,The 14th century gives us back two contradictory images: a glittering time of crusades and castles; cathedrals and chivalry; and a dark time of ferocity and spiritual agony; a world plunged into a chaos of war; fear and the Plague.

 The Warmth of Other Suns The Epic Story of Americas Great Migration,Isabel Wilkerson,In this epic; beautifully written masterwork; Pulitzer Prize–winning author Isabel Wilkerson chronicles one of the great untold stories of American history: the decades-long migration of black citizens who fled the South for northern and western cities; in search of a better life. From 1915 to 1970; this exodus of almost six million people changed the face of America. Wilkerson compares this epic migration to the migrations of other peoples in history. She interviewed more than a thousand people; and gained access to new data and official records; to write this definitive and vividly dramatic account of how these American journeys unfolded; altering our cities; our country; and ourselves.With stunning historical detail; Wilkerson tells this story through the lives of three unique individuals: Ida Mae Gladney; who in 1937 left sharecropping and prejudice in Mississippi for Chicago; where she achieved quiet blue-collar success and; in old age; voted for Barack Obama when he ran for an Illinois Senate seat; sharp and quick-tempered George Starling; who in 1945 fled Florida for Harlem; where he endangered his job fighting for civil rights; saw his family fall; and finally found peace in God; and Robert Foster; who left Louisiana in 1953 to pursue a medical career; the personal physician to Ray Charles as part of a glitteringly successful medical career; which allowed him to purchase a grand home where he often threw exuberant parties.Wilkerson brilliantly captures their first treacherous and exhausting cross-country trips by car and train and their new lives in colonies that grew into ghettos; as well as how they changed these cities with southern food; faith; and culture and improved them with discipline; drive; and hard work. Both a riveting microcosm and a major assessment; The Warmth of Other Suns is a bold; remarkable; and riveting work; a superb account of an “unrecognized immigration” within our own land. Through the breadth of its narrative; the beauty of the writing; the depth of its research; and the fullness of the people and lives portrayed herein; this book is destined to become a classic.,4.39,66141,8291,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8171378-the-warmth-of-other-suns
 The Histories,Herodotus,"One of the masterpieces of classical literature; the ""Histories"" describes how a small and quarrelsome band of Greek city states united to repel the might of the Persian empire. But while this epic struggle forms the core of his work; Herodotus' natural curiosity frequently gives rise to colorful digressions - a description of the natural wonders of Egypt; an account of European lake-dwellers; and far-fetched accounts of dog-headed men and gold-digging ants. With its kaleidoscopic blend of fact and legend; the ""Histories"" offers a compelling Greek view of the world of the fifth century BC.",3.98,43151,1255,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1362.The_Histories
 Killers of the Flower Moon The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI,David Grann,In the 1920s; the richest people per capita in the world were members of the Osage Indian Nation in Oklahoma. After oil was discovered beneath their land; the Osage rode in chauffeured automobiles; built mansions; and sent their children to study in Europe.Then; one by one; they began to be killed off. One Osage woman; Mollie Burkhart; watched as her family was murdered. Her older sister was shot. Her mother was then slowly poisoned. And it was just the beginning; as more Osage began to die under mysterious circumstances.In this last remnant of the Wild West—where oilmen like J. P. Getty made their fortunes and where desperadoes such as Al Spencer; “the Phantom Terror;” roamed – virtually anyone who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered. As the death toll surpassed more than twenty-four Osage; the newly created F.B.I. took up the case; in what became one of the organization’s first major homicide investigations. But the bureau was then notoriously corrupt and initially bungled the case. Eventually the young director; J. Edgar Hoover; turned to a former Texas Ranger named Tom White to try to unravel the mystery. White put together an undercover team; including one of the only Native American agents in the bureau. They infiltrated the region; struggling to adopt the latest modern techniques of detection. Together with the Osage they began to expose one of the most sinister conspiracies in American history.A true-life murder mystery about one of the most monstrous crimes in American history.,4.07,135574,15096,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29496076-killers-of-the-flower-moon
 King Leopolds Ghost,Adam Hochschild,In the 1880s; as the European powers were carving up Africa; King Leopold II of Belgium seized for himself the vast and mostly unexplored territory surrounding the Congo River. Carrying out a genocidal plundering of the Congo; he looted its rubber; brutalized its people; and ultimately slashed its population by ten million--all the while shrewdly cultivating his reputation as a great humanitarian. Heroic efforts to expose these crimes eventually led to the first great human rights movement of the twentieth century; in which everyone from Mark Twain to the Archbishop of Canterbury participated. King Leopold's Ghost is the haunting account of a megalomaniac of monstrous proportions; a man as cunning; charming; and cruel as any of the great Shakespearean villains. It is also the deeply moving portrait of those who fought Leopold: a brave handful of missionaries; travelers; and young idealists who went to Africa for work or adventure and unexpectedly found themselves witnesses to a holocaust. Adam Hochschild brings this largely untold story alive with the wit and skill of a Barbara Tuchman. Like her; he knows that history often provides a far richer cast of characters than any novelist could invent. Chief among them is Edmund Morel; a young British shipping agent who went on to lead the international crusade against Leopold. Another hero of this tale; the Irish patriot Roger Casement; ended his life on a London gallows. Two courageous black Americans; George Washington Williams and William Sheppard; risked much to bring evidence of the Congo atrocities to the outside world. Sailing into the middle of the story was a young Congo River steamboat officer named Joseph Conrad. And looming above them all; the duplicitous billionaire King Leopold II. With great power and compassion; King Leopold's Ghost will brand the tragedy of the Congo--too long forgotten--onto the conscience of the West,4.13,44854,2857,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40961621-king-leopold-s-ghost

 Collapse How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed,Jared Diamond,Brilliant; illuminating; and immensely absorbing; Collapse is destined to take its place as one of the essential books of our time; raising the urgent question: How can our world best avoid committing ecological suicide?In his million-copy bestseller Guns; Germs; and Steel; Jared Diamond examined how and why Western civilizations developed the technologies and immunities that allowed them to dominate much of the world. Now in this brilliant companion volume; Diamond probes the other side of the equation: What caused some of the great civilizations of the past to collapse into ruin; and what can we learn from their fates?As in Guns; Germs; and Steel; Diamond weaves an all-encompassing global thesis through a series of fascinating historical-cultural narratives. Moving from the Polynesian cultures on Easter Island to the flourishing American civilizations of the Anasazi and the Maya and finally to the doomed Viking colony on Greenland; Diamond traces the fundamental pattern of catastrophe. Environmental damage; climate change; rapid population growth; and unwise political choices were all factors in the demise of these societies; but other societies found solutions and persisted. Similar problems face us today and have already brought disaster to Rwanda and Haiti; even as China and Australia are trying to cope in innovative ways. Despite our own society's apparently inexhaustible wealth and unrivaled political power; ominous warning signs have begun to emerge even in ecologically robust areas like Montana.Brilliant; illuminating; and immensely absorbing; Collapse is destined to take its place as one of the essential books of our time; raising the urgent question: How can our world best avoid committing ecological suicide?,3.92,63572,3373,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/475.Collapse

 Destiny of the Republic A Tale of Madness; Medicine and the Murder of a President,Candice Millard,James A. Garfield was one of the most extraordinary men ever elected president. Born into abject poverty; he rose to become a wunderkind scholar; a Civil War hero; and a renowned and admired reformist congressman. Nominated for president against his will; he engaged in a fierce battle with the corrupt political establishment. But four months after his inauguration; a deranged office seeker tracked Garfield down and shot him in the back. But the shot didn’t kill Garfield. The drama of what hap­pened subsequently is a powerful story of a nation in tur­moil. The unhinged assassin’s half-delivered strike shattered the fragile national mood of a country so recently fractured by civil war; and left the wounded president as the object of a bitter behind-the-scenes struggle for power—over his administration; over the nation’s future; and; hauntingly; over his medical care. A team of physicians administered shockingly archaic treatments; to disastrous effect. As his con­dition worsened; Garfield received help: Alexander Graham Bell; the inventor of the telephone; worked around the clock to invent a new device capable of finding the bullet. Meticulously researched; epic in scope; and pulsating with an intimate human focus and high-velocity narrative drive; The Destiny of the Republic will stand alongside The Devil in the White City and The Professor and the Madman as a classic of narrative history.,4.16,59568,6189,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10335318-destiny-of-the-republic
 Homo Deus A History of Tomorrow,Yuval Noah Harari,Yuval Noah Harari; author of the critically-acclaimed New York Times bestseller and international phenomenon Sapiens; returns with an equally original; compelling; and provocative book; turning his focus toward humanity’s future; and our quest to upgrade humans into gods.Over the past century humankind has managed to do the impossible and rein in famine; plague; and war. This may seem hard to accept; but; as Harari explains in his trademark style—thorough; yet riveting—famine; plague and war have been transformed from incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces of nature into manageable challenges. For the first time ever; more people die from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers; terrorists and criminals put together. The average American is a thousand times more likely to die from binging at McDonalds than from being blown up by Al Qaeda.What then will replace famine; plague; and war at the top of the human agenda? As the self-made gods of planet earth; what destinies will we set ourselves; and which quests will we undertake? Homo Deus explores the projects; dreams and nightmares that will shape the twenty-first century—from overcoming death to creating artificial life. It asks the fundamental questions: Where do we go from here? And how will we protect this fragile world from our own destructive powers? This is the next stage of evolution. This is Homo Deus.With the same insight and clarity that made Sapiens an international hit and a New York Times bestseller; Harari maps out our future. ,4.23,159979,11364,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31138556-homo-deus
 In the Heart of the Sea The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex,Nathaniel Philbrick,"""With its huge; scarred head halfway out of the water and its tail beating the ocean into a white-water wake more than forty feet across; the whale approached the ship at twice its original speed - at least six knots. With a tremendous cracking and splintering of oak; it struck the ship just beneath the anchor secured at the cat-head on the port bow..."" In the Heart of the Sea brings to new life the incredible story of the wreck of the whaleship Essex - an event as mythic in its own century as the Titanic disaster in ours; and the inspiration for the climax of Moby-Dick. In a harrowing page-turner; Nathaniel Philbrick restores this epic story to its rightful place in American history.In 1820; the 240-ton Essex set sail from Nantucket on a routine voyage for whales. Fifteen months later; in the farthest reaches of the South Pacific; it was repeatedly rammed and sunk by an eighty-ton bull sperm whale. Its twenty-man crew; fearing cannibals on the islands to the west; made for the 3;000-mile-distant coast of South America in three tiny boats. During ninety days at sea under horrendous conditions; the survivors clung to life as one by one; they succumbed to hunger; thirst; disease; and fear.Philbrick interweaves his account of this extraordinary ordeal of ordinary men with a wealth of whale lore and with a brilliantly detailed portrait of the lost; unique community of Nantucket whalers. Impeccably researched and beautifully told; the book delivers the ultimate portrait of man against nature; drawing on a remarkable range of archival and modern sources; including a long-lost account by the ship's cabin boy.At once a literary companion and a page-turner that speaks to the same issues of class; race; and man's relationship to nature that permeate the works of Melville; In the Heart of the Sea will endure as a vital work of American history.",4.13,88921,5934,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17780.In_the_Heart_of_the_Sea
 History of the Peloponnesian War,Thucydides,Written four hundred years before the birth of Christ; this detailed contemporary account of the long life-and-death struggle between Athens and Sparta stands an excellent chance of fulfilling its author's ambitious claim. Thucydides himself (c.460-400 BC) was an Athenian and achieved the rank of general in the earlier stages of the war. He applied thereafter a passion for accuracy and a contempt for myth and romance in compiling this factual record of a disastrous conflict.,3.90,31161,858,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/261243.History_of_the_Peloponnesian_War
 The Ghost Map The Story of Londons Most Terrifying Epidemicand How It Changed Science; Cities; and the Modern World,Steven Johnson,From Steven Johnson; the dynamic thinker routinely compared to James Gleick; Dava Sobel; and Malcolm Gladwell; The Ghost Map is a riveting page-turner about a real-life historical hero; Dr. John Snow. It's the summer of 1854; and London is just emerging as one of the first modern cities in the world. But lacking the infrastructure—garbage removal; clean water; sewers—necessary to support its rapidly expanding population; the city has become the perfect breeding ground for a terrifying disease no one knows how to cure. As the cholera outbreak takes hold; a physician and a local curate are spurred to action—and ultimately solve the most pressing medical riddle of their time. In a triumph of multidisciplinary thinking; Johnson illuminates the intertwined histories and inter-connectedness of the spread of disease; contagion theory; the rise of cities; and the nature of scientific inquiry; offering both a riveting history and a powerful explanation of how it has shaped the world we live in.,3.88,43714,3954,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36086.The_Ghost_Map
 At Home A Short History of Private Life,Bill Bryson,“Houses aren’t refuges from history. They are where history ends up.”Bill Bryson and his family live in a Victorian parsonage in a part of England where nothing of any great significance has happened since the Romans decamped. Yet one day; he began to consider how very little he knew about the ordinary things of life as he found it in that comfortable home. To remedy this; he formed the idea of journeying about his house from room to room to “write a history of the world without leaving home.” The bathroom provides the occasion for a history of hygiene; the bedroom; sex; death; and sleep; the kitchen; nutrition and the spice trade; and so on; as Bryson shows how each has figured in the evolution of private life. Whatever happens in the world; he demonstrates; ends up in our house; in the paint and the pipes and the pillows and every item of furniture.(front flap),3.97,82301,6406,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7507825-at-home

In 1803 President Thomas Jefferson selected his personal secretary; Captain Meriwether Lewis; to lead a pioneering voyage across the Great Plains and into the Rockies. It was completely uncharted territory; a wild; vast land ruled by the Indians. Charismatic and brave; Lewis was the perfect choice and he experienced the savage North American continent before any other white man. UNDAUNTED COURAGE is the tale of a hero; but it is also a tragedy. Lewis may have received a hero's welcome on his return to Washington in 1806; but his discoveries did not match the president's fantasies of sweeping; fertile plains ripe for the taking. Feeling the expedition had been a failure; Lewis took to drink and piled up debts. Full of colourful characters - Jefferson; the president obsessed with conquering the west; William Clark; the rugged frontiersman; Sacagawea; the Indian girl who accompanied the expedition; Drouillard; the French-Indian hunter - this is one of the great adventure stories of all time and it shot to the top of the US bestseller charts. Drama; suspense; danger and diplomacy combine with romance and personal tragedy making UNDAUNTED COURAGE an outstanding work of scholarship and a thrilling adventure.,4.17,53862,2580,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45546.Undaunted_Courage
 Longitude The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time,Dava Sobel,"Anyone alive in the eighteenth century would have known that ""the longitude problem"" was the thorniest scientific dilemma of the day—and had been for centuries. Lacking the ability to measure their longitude; sailors throughout the great ages of exploration had been literally lost at sea as soon as they lost sight of land. Thousands of lives; and the increasing fortunes of nations; hung on a resolution.The scientific establishment of Europe—from Galileo to Sir Issac Newton—had mapped the heavens in both hemispheres in its certain pursuit of a celestial answer. In stark contrast; one man; John Harrison; dared to imagine a mechanical solution—a clock that would keep precise time at sea; something no clock had ever been able to do on land. Longitude is a dramatic human story of an epic scientific quest and Harrison's forty-year obsession with building his perfect timekeeper; known today as the chronometer. Full of heroism and chicanery; it is also a fascinating brief history of astronomy; navigation; and clock-making; and opens a new window on our world.On its 10th anniversary; a gift edition of this classic book; with a forward by one of history's greatest explorers; and eight pages of color illustrations.",3.95,61823,2822,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4806.Longitude
 The Radium Girls The Dark Story of Americas Shining Women,Kate  Moore,"
The incredible true story of the women who fought America's Undark danger
The Curies' newly discovered element of radium makes gleaming headlines across the nation as the fresh face of beauty; and wonder drug of the medical community. From body lotion to tonic water; the popular new element shines bright in the otherwise dark years of the First World War.Meanwhile; hundreds of girls toil amidst the glowing dust of the radium-dial factories. The glittering chemical covers their bodies from head to toe; they light up the night like industrious fireflies. With such a coveted job; these ""shining girls"" are the luckiest alive — until they begin to fall mysteriously ill.But the factories that once offered golden opportunities are now ignoring all claims of the gruesome side effects; and the women's cries of corruption. And as the fatal poison of the radium takes hold; the brave shining girls find themselves embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of America's early 20th century; and in a groundbreaking battle for workers' rights that will echo for centuries to come. Written with a sparkling voice and breakneck pace; The Radium Girls fully illuminates the inspiring young women exposed to the ""wonder"" substance of radium; and their awe-inspiring strength in the face of almost impossible circumstances. Their courage and tenacity led to life-changing regulations; research into nuclear bombing; and ultimately saved hundreds of thousands of lives...",4.14,85932,11663,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31409135-the-radium-girls
 Founding Brothers The Revolutionary Generation,Joseph J. Ellis,"Informs our understanding of American politics--then and now--and gives us a new perspective on the unpredictable forces that shape history.An illuminating study of the intertwined lives of the founders of the American republic--John Adams; Aaron Burr; Benjamin Franklin; Alexander Hamilton; Thomas Jefferson; James Madison; and George Washington.During the 1790s; which Ellis calls the most decisive decade in our nation's history; the greatest statesmen of their generation--and perhaps any--came together to define the new republic and direct its course for the coming centuries. Ellis focuses on six discrete moments that exemplify the most crucial issues facing the fragile new nation: Burr and Hamilton's deadly duel; and what may have really happened; Hamilton; Jefferson; and Madison's secret dinner; during which the seat of the permanent capital was determined in exchange for passage of Hamilton's financial plan; Franklin's petition to end the ""peculiar institution"" of slavery--his last public act--and Madison's efforts to quash it; Washington's precedent-setting Farewell Address; announcing his retirement from public office and offering his country some final advice; Adams's difficult term as Washington's successor and his alleged scheme to pass the presidency on to his son; and finally; Adams and Jefferson's renewed correspondence at the end of their lives; in which they compared their different views of the Revolution and its legacy.In a lively and engaging narrative; Ellis recounts the sometimes collaborative; sometimes archly antagonistic interactions between these men; and shows us the private characters behind the public personas: Adams; the ever-combative iconoclast; whose closest political collaborator was his wife; Abigail; Burr; crafty; smooth; and one of the most despised public figures of his time; Hamilton; whose audacious manner and deep economic savvy masked his humble origins; Jefferson; renowned for his eloquence; but so reclusive and taciturn that he rarely spoke more than a few sentences in public; Madison; small; sickly; and paralyzingly shy; yet one of the most effective debaters of his generation; and the stiffly formal Washington; the ultimate realist; larger-than-life; and America's only truly indispensable figure.Ellis argues that the checks and balances that permitted the infant American republic to endure were not primarily legal; constitutional; or institutional; but intensely personal; rooted in the dynamic interaction of leaders with quite different visions and values. Revisiting the old-fashioned idea that character matters; Founding Brothers informs our understanding of American politics--then and now--and gives us a new perspective on the unpredictable forces that shape history.",3.94,41874,1896,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7493.Founding_Brothers
 How the Irish Saved Civilization The Untold Story of Irelands Heroic Role from the Fall of Rome to the Rise of Medieval Europe,Thomas Cahill,"From the fall of Rome to the rise of Charlemagne - the ""dark ages"" - learning; scholarship; and culture disappeared from the European continent. The great heritage of western civilization - from the Greek and Roman classics to Jewish and Christian works - would have been utterly lost were it not for the holy men and women of unconquered Ireland. In this delightful and illuminating look into a crucial but little-known ""hinge"" of history; Thomas Cahill takes us to the ""island of saints and scholars; "" the Ireland of St. Patrick and the Book of Kells. Here; far from the barbarian despoliation of the continent; monks and scribes laboriously; lovingly; even playfully preserved the west's written treasures. With the return of stability in Europe; these Irish scholars were instrumental in spreading learning. Thus the Irish not only were conservators of civilization; but became shapers of the medieval mind; putting their unique stamp on western culture.",3.81,41010,1745,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25669.How_the_Irish_Saved_Civilization

 Battle Cry of Freedom,James M. McPherson,"Filled with fresh interpretations and information; puncturing old myths and challenging new ones; Battle Cry of Freedom will unquestionably become the standard one-volume history of the Civil War. James McPherson's fast-paced narrative fully integrates the political; social; and military events that crowded the two decades from the outbreak of one war in Mexico to the ending of another at Appomattox. Packed with drama and analytical insight; the book vividly recounts the momentous episodes that preceded the Civil War--the Dred Scott decision; the Lincoln-Douglas debates; John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry--and then moves into a masterful chronicle of the war itself--the battles; the strategic maneuvering on both sides; the politics; and the personalities. Particularly notable are McPherson's new views on such matters as the slavery expansion issue in the 1850s; the origins of the Republican Party; the causes of secession; internal dissent and anti-war opposition in the North and the South; and the reasons for the Union's victory. The book's title refers to the sentiments that informed both the Northern and Southern views of the conflict: the South seceded in the name of that freedom of self-determination and self-government for which their fathers had fought in 1776; while the North stood fast in defense of the Union founded by those fathers as the bulwark of American liberty. Eventually; the North had to grapple with the underlying cause of the war--slavery--and adopt a policy of emancipation as a second war aim. This ""new birth of freedom;"" as Lincoln called it; constitutes the proudest legacy of America's bloodiest conflict. This authoritative volume makes sense of that vast and confusing ""second American Revolution"" we call the Civil War; a war that transformed a nation and expanded our heritage of liberty.",4.36,26662,1250,historical-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35100.Battle_Cry_of_Freedom

 World War Z An Oral History of the Zombie War,Max Brooks,"The Zombie War came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. Max Brooks; driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years; traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world; from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men; women; and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living; or at least the undead; hell of that dreadful time. World War Z is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror; and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance; that gripped human society through the plague years.Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China; where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero; to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold; to the United States of Southern Africa; where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price; to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn; this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War.Most of all; the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader; but the effort is invaluable because; as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction; ""By excluding the human factor; aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may; heaven forbid; lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end; isn't the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as 'the living dead'?""Note: Some of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission.",4.01,451554,25905,history,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8908.World_War_Z

 House of Leaves,Mark Z. Danielewski,Years ago; when House of Leaves was first being passed around; it was nothing more than a badly bundled heap of paper; parts of which would occasionally surface on the Internet. No one could have anticipated the small but devoted following this terrifying story would soon command. Starting with an odd assortment of marginalized youth—musicians; tattoo artists; programmers; strippers; environmentalists; and adrenaline junkies—the book eventually made its way into the hands of older generations; who not only found themselves in those strangely arranged pages but also discovered a way back into the lives of their estranged children.Now; for the first time; this astonishing novel is made available in book form; complete with the original colored words; vertical footnotes; and newly added second and third appendices.The story remains unchanged; focusing on a young family that moves into a small home on Ash Tree Lane where they discover something is terribly wrong: their house is bigger on the inside than it is on the outside.Of course; neither Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Will Navidson nor his companion Karen Green was prepared to face the consequences of that impossibility; until the day their two little children wandered off and their voices eerily began to return another story—of creature darkness; of an ever-growing abyss behind a closet door; and of that unholy growl which soon enough would tear through their walls and consume all their dreams.,4.05,137523,11399,history,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24800.House_of_Leaves

She’s not sure what she will find—her cousin’s husband; a handsome Englishman; is a stranger; and Noemí knows little about the region.  Noemí is also an unlikely rescuer: She’s a glamorous debutante; and her chic gowns and perfect red lipstick are more suited for cocktail parties than amateur sleuthing. But she’s also tough and smart; with an indomitable will; and she is not afraid: Not of her cousin’s new husband; who is both menacing and alluring; not of his father; the ancient patriarch who seems to be fascinated by Noemí; and not even of the house itself; which begins to invade Noemi’s dreams with visions of blood and doom. Her only ally in this inhospitable abode is the family’s youngest son. Shy and gentle; he seems to want to help Noemí; but might also be hiding dark knowledge of his family’s past. For there are many secrets behind the walls of High Place.

 Educated,Tara Westover,"Tara Westover was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho; she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her ""head-for-the-hills bag"". In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother; a midwife and healer; and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard.Her father forbade hospitals; so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions; even burns from explosions; were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.Then; lacking any formal education; Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University; where she studied history; learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her; taking her over oceans and across continents; to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far; if there was still a way home.Educated is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers; Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.Librarian's note: An alternate cover edition can be found here",4.46,872763,72650,horror,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35133922-educated
 The Glass Castle,Jeannette Walls,"A tender; moving tale of unconditional love in a family that; despite its profound flaws; gave the author the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms.Jeannette Walls grew up with parents whose ideals and stubborn nonconformity were both their curse and their salvation. Rex and Rose Mary Walls had four children. In the beginning; they lived like nomads; moving among Southwest desert towns; camping in the mountains. Rex was a charismatic; brilliant man who; when sober; captured his children's imagination; teaching them physics; geology; and above all; how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary; who painted and wrote and couldn't stand the responsibility of providing for her family; called herself an ""excitement addict."" Cooking a meal that would be consumed in fifteen minutes had no appeal when she could make a painting that might last forever. Later; when the money ran out; or the romance of the wandering life faded; the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town -- and the family -- Rex Walls had done everything he could to escape. He drank. He stole the grocery money and disappeared for days. As the dysfunction of the family escalated; Jeannette and her brother and sisters had to fend for themselves; supporting one another as they weathered their parents' betrayals and; finally; found the resources and will to leave home. What is so astonishing about Jeannette Walls is not just that she had the guts and tenacity and intelligence to get out; but that she describes her parents with such deep affection and generosity.

 Born a Crime Stories From a South African Childhood,Trevor Noah,The memoir of one man’s coming-of-age; set during the twilight of apartheid and the tumultuous days of freedom that followed. Trevor Noah’s unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal act: his birth.

 Eat; Pray; Love,Elizabeth Gilbert,A celebrated writer's irresistible; candid; and eloquent account of her pursuit of worldly pleasure; spiritual devotion; and what she really wanted out of life. Around the time Elizabeth Gilbert turned thirty; she went through an early-onslaught midlife crisis. She had everything an educated; ambitious American woman was supposed to want—a husband; a house; a successful career. But instead of feeling happy and fulfilled; she was consumed with panic; grief; and confusion. She went through a divorce; a crushing depression; another failed love; and the eradication of everything she ever thought she was supposed to be. To recover from all this; Gilbert took a radical step. In order to give herself the time and space to find out who she really was and what she really wanted; she got rid of her belongings; quit her job; and undertook a yearlong journey around the world—all alone. Eat; Pray; Love is the absorbing chronicle of that year. Her aim was to visit three places where she could examine one aspect of her own nature set against the backdrop of a culture that has traditionally done that one thing very well. In Rome; she studied the art of pleasure; learning to speak Italian and gaining the twenty-three happiest pounds of her life. India was for the art of devotion; and with the help of a native guru and a surprisingly wise cowboy from Texas; she embarked on four uninterrupted months of spiritual exploration. In Bali; she studied the art of balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence. She became the pupil of an elderly medicine man and also fell in love the best way—unexpectedly. An intensely articulate and moving memoir of self-discovery; Eat; Pray; Love is about what can happen when you claim responsibility for your own contentment and stop trying to live in imitation of society’s ideals.

 Hillbilly Elegy A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis,J.D. Vance,Hillbilly Elegy is a passionate and personal analysis of a culture in crisis—that of white working-class Americans. The disintegration of this group; a process that has been slowly occurring now for more than forty years; has been reported with growing frequency and alarm; but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside. J. D. Vance tells the true story of what a social; regional; and class decline feels like when you were born with it hung around your neck.The Vance family story begins hopefully in postwar America. J. D.’s grandparents were “dirt poor and in love;” and moved north from Kentucky’s Appalachia region to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. They raised a middle-class family; and eventually one of their grandchildren would graduate from Yale Law School; a conventional marker of success in achieving generational upward mobility. But as the family saga of Hillbilly Elegy plays out; we learn that J.D.'s grandparents; aunt; uncle; sister; and; most of all; his mother struggled profoundly with the demands of their new middle-class life; never fully escaping the legacy of abuse; alcoholism; poverty; and trauma so characteristic of their part of America. With piercing honesty; Vance shows how he himself still carries around the demons of his chaotic family history.A deeply moving memoir; with its share of humor and vividly colorful figures; Hillbilly Elegy is the story of how upward mobility really feels. And it is an urgent and troubling meditation on the loss of the American dream for a large segment of this country.,3.92,322886,29004,horror,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27161156-hillbilly-elegy
 When Breath Becomes Air,Paul Kalanithi,"For readers of Atul Gawande; Andrew Solomon; and Anne Lamott; a profoundly moving; exquisitely observed memoir by a young neurosurgeon faced with a terminal cancer diagnosis who attempts to answer the question 'What makes a life worth living?'At the age of thirty-six; on the verge of completing a decade's worth of training as a neurosurgeon; Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. One day he was a doctor treating the dying; and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that; the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi's transformation from a naïve medical student ""possessed;"" as he wrote; ""by the question of what; given that all organisms die; makes a virtuous and meaningful life"" into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain; the most critical place for human identity; and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality. What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future; no longer a ladder toward your goals in life; flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child; to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving; exquisitely observed memoir. Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015; while working on this book; yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. ""I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality; in a sense; had changed nothing and everything;"" he wrote.

 Angelas Ashes,Frank McCourt,"Imbued on every page with Frank McCourt's astounding humor and compassion. This is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.""When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I managed to survive at all. It was; of course; a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood; and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood."" So begins the Pulitzer Prize winning memoir of Frank McCourt; born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick; Ireland.

I buried the girl I was because she ran into all kinds of trouble. I tried to erase every memory of her; but she is still there; somewhere. . . . I was trapped in my body; one that I barely recognized or understood; but at least I was safe.”In her phenomenally popular essays and long-running Tumblr blog; Roxane Gay has written with intimacy and sensitivity about food and body; using her own emotional and psychological struggles as a means of exploring our shared anxieties over pleasure; consumption; appearance; and health.

 Between the World and Me,Ta-Nehisi Coates,“This is your country; this is your world; this is your body; and you must find some way to live within the all of it.” In a profound work that pivots from the biggest questions about American history and ideals to the most intimate concerns of a father for his son; Ta-Nehisi Coates offers a powerful new framework for understanding our nation’s history and current crisis. Americans have built an empire on the idea of “race;” a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men—bodies exploited through slavery and segregation; and; today; threatened; locked up; and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden?  Between the World and Me is Ta-Nehisi Coates’s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son—and readers—the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences; from Howard University to Civil War battlefields; from the South Side of Chicago to Paris; from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children’s lives were taken as American plunder. Beautifully woven from personal narrative; reimagined history; and fresh; emotionally charged reportage; Between the World and Me clearly illuminates the past; bracingly confronts our present; and offers a transcendent vision for a way forward.,4.38,254896,24290,horror,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25489625-between-the-world-and-me

 Girl; Interrupted,Susanna Kaysen,"In 1967; after a session with a psychiatrist she'd never seen before; eighteen-year-old Susanna Kaysen was put in a taxi and sent to McLean Hospital. She spent most of the next two years on the ward for teenage girls in a psychiatric hospital as renowned for its famous clientele--Sylvia Plath; Robert Lowell; James Taylor; and Ray Charles--as for its progressive methods of treating those who could afford its sanctuary. Kaysen's memoir encompasses horror and razor-edged perception while providing vivid portraits of her fellow patients and their keepers. It is a brilliant evocation of a ""parallel universe"" set within the kaleidoscopically shifting landscape of the late sixties. Girl; Interrupted is a clear-sighted; unflinching documnet that gives lasting and specific dimension to our definitions of sane and insane; mental illness and recovery.",3.90,184579,4728,horror,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68783.Girl_Interrupted

 Know My Name,Chanel Miller,She was known to the world as Emily Doe when she stunned millions with a letter. Brock Turner had been sentenced to just six months in county jail after he was found sexually assaulting her on Stanford’s campus. Her victim impact statement was posted on BuzzFeed; where it instantly went viral–viewed by eleven million people within four days; it was translated globally and read on the floor of Congress; it inspired changes in California law and the recall of the judge in the case. Thousands wrote to say that she had given them the courage to share their own experiences of assault for the first time.Now she reclaims her identity to tell her story of trauma; transcendence; and the power of words. It was the perfect case; in many ways–there were eyewitnesses; Turner ran away; physical evidence was immediately secured. But her struggles with isolation and shame during the aftermath and the trial reveal the oppression victims face in even the best-case scenarios. Her story illuminates a culture biased to protect perpetrators; indicts a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable; and; ultimately; shines with the courage required to move through suffering and live a full and beautiful life.Know My Name will forever transform the way we think about sexual assault; challenging our beliefs about what is acceptable and speaking truth to the tumultuous reality of healing. It also introduces readers to an extraordinary writer; one whose words have already changed our world.

 Hyperbole and a Half Unfortunate Situations; Flawed Coping Mechanisms; Mayhem; and Other Things That Happened,Allie Brosh,This is a book I wrote. Because I wrote it; I had to figure out what to put on the back cover to explain what it is. I tried to write a long; third-person summary that would imply how great the book is and also sound vaguely authoritative--like maybe someone who isn’t me wrote it--but I soon discovered that I’m not sneaky enough to pull it off convincingly. So I decided to just make a list of things that are in the book:PicturesWordsStories about things that happened to meStories about things that happened to other people because of meEight billion dollars*Stories about dogsThe secret to eternal happiness**These are lies.

 The Princess Diarist,Carrie Fisher,The last book from beloved Hollywood icon Carrie Fisher; The Princess Diarist is an intimate; hilarious; and revealing recollection of what happened behind the scenes on one of the most famous film sets of all time; the first Star Wars movie. When Carrie Fisher discovered the journals she kept during the filming of the first Star Wars movie; she was astonished to see what they had preserved--plaintive love poems; unbridled musings with youthful naivet�; and a vulnerability that she barely recognized. Before her passing; her fame as an author; actress; and pop-culture icon was indisputable; but in 1977; Carrie Fisher was just a teenager with an all-consuming crush on her costar; Harrison Ford.With these excerpts from her handwritten notebooks; The Princess Diarist is Fisher's intimate and revealing recollection of what happened on one of the most famous film sets of all time--and what developed behind the scenes.

 Wishful Drinking,Carrie Fisher,"In Wishful Drinking; Carrie Fisher tells the true and intoxicating story of her life with inimitable wit. Born to celebrity parents; she was picked to play a princess in a little movie called Star Wars when only 19 years old. ""But it isn't all sweetness and light sabres."" Alas; aside from a demanding career and her role as a single mother (not to mention the hyperspace hairdo); Carrie also spends her free time battling addiction; weathering the wild ride of manic depression and lounging around various mental institutions. It's an incredible tale—from having Elizabeth Taylor as a stepmother; to marrying (and divorcing) Paul Simon; from having the father of her daughter leave her for a man; to ultimately waking up one morning and finding a friend dead beside her in bed.",3.80,67052,7111,horror,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4961048-wishful-drinking
 A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,Dave Eggers,"'When you read his extraordinary memoir you don't laugh; then cry; then laugh again; you somehow experience these emotions all at once.'""Well; this was when Bill was sighing a lot. He had decided that after our parents died he just didn't want any more fighting between what was left of us. He was twenty-four; Beth was twenty-three; I was twenty-one; Toph was eight; and all of us were so tried already; from that winter. So when something would come up; any little thing; some bill to pay or decision to make; he would just sigh; his eyes tired; his mouth in a sorry kind of smile. But Beth and I...Jesus; we were fighting with everyone; anyone; each other; with strangers at bars; anywhere -- we were angry people wanting to exact revenge. We came to California and we wanted everything; would take what was ours; anything within reach. And I decided that little Toph and I; he with his backward hat and long hair; living together in our little house in Berkeley; would be world-destroyers. We inherited each other and; we felt; a responsibility to reinvent everything; to scoff and re-create and drive fast while singing loudly and pounding the windows. It was a hopeless sort of exhilaration; a kind of arrogance born of fatalism; I guess; of the feeling that if you could lose a couple of parents in a month; then basically anything could happen; at any time -- all bullets bear your name; all cars are there to crush you; any balcony could give way; more disaster seemed only logical. And then; as in Dorothy's dream; all these people I grew up with were there; too; some of them orphans also; most but not all of us believing that what we had been given was extraordinary; that it was time to tear or break down; ruin; remake; take and devour. This was San Francisco; you know; and everyone had some dumb idea -- I mean; wicca? -- and no one there would tell you yours was doomed. Thus the public nudity; and this ridiculous magazine; and the Real World tryout; all this need; most of it disguised by sneering; but all driven by a hyper-awareness of this window; I guess; a few years when your muscles are taut; coiled up and vibrating. But what to do with the energy? I mean; when we drive; Toph and I; and we drive past people; standing on top of all these hills; part of me wants to stop the car and turn up the radio and have us all dance in formation; and part of me wants to run them all over.""",3.68,174658,9223,horror,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4953.A_Heartbreaking_Work_of_Staggering_Genius

 Lab Girl,Hope Jahren,Acclaimed scientist Hope Jahren has built three laboratories in which she’s studied trees; flowers; seeds; and soil. Her first book is a revelatory treatise on plant life—but it is also so much more. Lab Girl is a book about work; love; and the mountains that can be moved when those two things come together.

Why does music evoke such powerful moods? The answers are at last be- coming clear; thanks to revolutionary neuroscience and the emerging field of evolutionary psychology.

 The Rest Is Noise Listening to the Twentieth Century,Alex  Ross,The Rest Is Noise: Listening to the Twentieth Century is a voyage into the labyrinth of modern music; which remains an obscure world for most people. While paintings of Picasso and Jackson Pollock sell for a hundred million dollars or more; and lines from T. S. Eliot are quoted on the yearbook pages of alienated teenagers across the land; twentieth-century classical music still sends ripples of unease through audiences. At the same time; its influence can be felt everywhere. Atonal chords crop up in jazz. Avant-garde sounds populate the soundtracks of Hollywood thrillers. Minimalism has had a huge effect on rock; pop; and dance music from the Velvet Underground onward.The Rest Is Noise shows why twentieth-century composers felt compelled to create a famously bewildering variety of sounds; from the purest beauty to the purest noise. It tells of a remarkable array of maverick personalities who resisted the cult of the classical past; struggled against the indifference of a wide public; and defied the will of dictators. Whether they have charmed audiences with sweet sounds or battered them with dissonance; composers have always been exuberantly of the present; defying the stereotype of classical music as a dying art. The narrative goes from Vienna before the First World War to Paris in the twenties; from Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia to downtown New York in the sixties and seventies. We follow the rise of mass culture and mass politics; of dramatic new technologies; of hot and cold wars; of experiments; revolutions; riots; and friendships forged and broken. The end result is not so much a history of twentieth-century music as a history of the twentieth century through its music.,4.08,13433,754,memoir,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/392563.The_Rest_Is_Noise

 Our Band Could Be Your Life Scenes from the American Indie Underground; 1981-1991,Michael Azerrad,This is the never-before-told story of the musical revolution that happened right under the nose of the Reagan Eighties--when a small but sprawling network of bands; labels; fanzines; radio stations; and other subversives reenergized American rock with punk rock's do-it-yourself credo and created music that was deeply personal; often brilliant; always challenging; and immensely influential.

Among the bands profiled: Mission of Burma; Butthole Surfers; The Minutemen; Sonic Youth; Black Flag; Big Black; Hüsker Dü; Fugazi; Minor Threat; Mudhoney; The Replacements; Beat Happening; and Dinosaur Jr.,4.19,13765,668,memoir,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29393.Our_Band_Could_Be_Your_Life

 Hunger Makes Me a Modern Girl,Carrie Brownstein,"From a leader of feminist punk music at the dawn of the riot-grrrl era; a candid and deeply personal look at life in rock and roll. Before Carrie Brownstein codeveloped and starred in the wildly popular TV comedy Portlandia; she was already an icon to young women for her role as a musician in the feminist punk band Sleater-Kinney. The band was a key part of the early riot- grrrl and indie rock scenes in the Pacific Northwest; known for their prodigious guitar shredding and their leftist lyrics against war; traditionalism; and gender roles.Hunger Makes Me a Modern Girl is the deeply personal and revealing narrative of Brownstein's life in music; from ardent fan to pioneering female guitarist to comedic performer and luminary in the independent rock world. Though Brownstein struggled against the music industry's sexist double standards; by 2006 she was the only woman to earn a spot on Rolling Stone readers' list of the ""25 Most Underrated Guitarists of All-Time."" This book intimately captures what it feels like to be a young woman in a rock-and-roll band; from her days at the dawn of the underground feminist punk-rock movement that would define music and pop culture in the 1990s through today.",3.82,31335,2602,memoir,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25065629-hunger-makes-me-a-modern-girl

 Rip it Up and Start Again,Simon Reynolds,Punk's raw power rejuvenated rock; but by the summer of 1977 the movement had become a parody of itself. RIP IT UP AND START AGAIN is a celebration of what happened next.Post-punk bands like PiL; Joy Division; Talking Heads; The Fall and The Human League dedicated themselves to fulfilling punk's unfinished musical revolution. The post-punk groups were fervent modernists; whether experimenting with electronics and machine rhythm or adapting ideas from dub reggae and disco; they were totally confident they could invent a whole new future for music.,4.06,7347,345,memoir,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/272642.Rip_it_Up_and_Start_Again
 Born to Run,Bruce Springsteen,“Writing about yourself is a funny business…But in a project like this; the writer has made one promise; to show the reader his mind. In these pages; I’ve tried to do this.” —Bruce Springsteen; from the pages of Born to RunIn 2009; Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band performed at the Super Bowl’s halftime show. The experience was so exhilarating that Bruce decided to write about it. That’s how this extraordinary autobiography began. Over the past seven years; Bruce Springsteen has privately devoted himself to writing the story of his life; bringing to these pages the same honesty; humor; and originality found in his songs. He describes growing up Catholic in Freehold; New Jersey; amid the poetry; danger; and darkness that fueled his imagination; leading up to the moment he refers to as “The Big Bang”: seeing Elvis Presley’s debut on The Ed Sullivan Show. He vividly recounts his relentless drive to become a musician; his early days as a bar band king in Asbury Park; and the rise of the E Street Band. With disarming candor; he also tells for the first time the story of the personal struggles that inspired his best work; and shows us why the song “Born to Run” reveals more than we previously realized. Born to Run will be revelatory for anyone who has ever enjoyed Bruce Springsteen; but this book is much more than a legendary rock star’s memoir. This is a book for workers and dreamers; parents and children; lovers and loners; artists; freaks; or anyone who has ever wanted to be baptized in the holy river of rock and roll. Rarely has a performer told his own story with such force and sweep. Like many of his songs (“Thunder Road;” “Badlands;” “Darkness on the Edge of Town;” “The River;” “Born in the U.S.A.;” “The Rising;” and “The Ghost of Tom Joad;” to name just a few); Bruce Springsteen’s autobiography is written with the lyricism of a singular songwriter and the wisdom of a man who has thought deeply about his experiences.,4.16,38898,4807,memoir,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29072594-born-to-run
 Scar Tissue,Anthony Kiedis,"Now in paperback; the New York Times bestseller by one of rock's most provocative figures Scar Tissue is Anthony Kiedis's searingly honest memoir of a life spent in the fast lane. In 1983; four self-described ""knuckleheads"" burst out of the mosh-pitted mosaic of the neo-punk rock scene in L.A. with their own unique brand of cosmic hardcore mayhem funk. Over twenty years later; the Red Hot Chili Peppers; against all odds; have become one of the most successful bands in the world. Though the band has gone through many incarnations; Anthony Kiedis; the group's lyricist and dynamic lead singer; has been there for the whole roller-coaster ride. Whether he's recollecting the influence of the beautiful; strong women who have been his muses; or retracing a journey that has included appearances as diverse as a performance before half a million people at Woodstock or an audience of one at the humble compound of the exiled Dalai Lama; Kiedis shares a compelling story about the price of success and excess. Scar Tissue is a story of dedication and debauchery; of intrigue and integrity; of recklessness and redemption--a story that could only have come out of the world of rock.",4.10,69020,2889,memoir,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/96647.Scar_Tissue
 The Dirt Confessions of the Worlds Most Notorious Rock Band,Neil Strauss,Whiskey and porn stars; hot reds and car crashes; black leather and high heels; overdoses and death. This is the life of Mötley Crüe; the heaviest drinking; hardest fighting; most oversexed and arrogant band in the world. Their unbelievable exploits are the stuff of rock 'n' roll legend. They nailed the hottest chicks; started the bloodiest fights; partied with the biggest drug dealers; and got to know the inside of every jail cell from California to Japan. They have dedicated an entire career to living life to its extreme; from the greatest fantasies to the darkest tragedies. Tommy married two international sex symbols; Vince killed a man and lost a daughter to cancer; Nikki overdosed; rose from the dead; and then OD'd again the next day; and Mick shot a woman and tried to hang his own brother. But that's just the beginning. Fueled by every drug they could get their hands on and obscene amounts of alcohol; driven by fury and headed straight for hell; Mötley Crüe raged through two decades; leaving behind a trail of debauched women; trashed hotel rooms; crashed cars; psychotic managers; and broken bones that has left the music industry cringing to this day. All these unspeakable acts; not to mention their dire consequences; are laid bare in The Dirt.Here -- directly from Nikki; Vince; Tommy; and Mick -- is the unexpurgated version of the whole glorious; gut-wrenching story. In these pages; published for the first time anywhere; are Tommy Lee's letters to Pamela Anderson from prison: Mick's confession to having an incurable disease that is slowly killing him; Vince's experience burying his own daughter -- and the train wreck that his life became afterward; and Nikki's anguished struggle to deal with an entire life fueled by anger over his childhood abandonment; his discovery of the family he never knew he had -- and his subsequent loss of them. And all of it accompanied by scores of rare; never-before-published photographs; mug shots; and handwritten lyrics. No one is spared. Not David Lee Roth; Ozzy Osbourne; Vanity; Aerosmith; Heather Locklear; AC/DC; Lita Ford; Iron Maiden; Pamela Anderson; Guns N' Roses; Donna D'Errico; RATT; or those two girls from Dallas; Texas.Make no mistake about it: these guys are geniuses. They invented glam metal and then left it in the dust; sold more than forty million albums from Shout at the Devil to Dr. Feelgood; toured the world dozen times and have the scars to prove it; and maintained a rabid following in an era of throwaway pop stars. Mötley Crüe has done nothing less than tattoo the psyche of the entire MTV generation. They are the ultimate rock 'n' roll band. And if you don't believe it; read The Dirt. You don't know what decadence is...,4.12,36137,2154,memoir,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25378.The_Dirt

 A Visit from the Goon Squad,Jennifer Egan,Jennifer Egan’s spellbinding interlocking narratives circle the lives of Bennie Salazar; an aging former punk rocker and record executive; and Sasha; the passionate; troubled young woman he employs. Although Bennie and Sasha never discover each other’s pasts; the reader does; in intimate detail; along with the secret lives of a host of other characters whose paths intersect with theirs; over many years; in locales as varied as New York; San Francisco; Naples; and Africa.We first meet Sasha in her mid-thirties; on her therapist’s couch in New York City; confronting her long-standing compulsion to steal. Later; we learn the genesis of her turmoil when we see her as the child of a violent marriage; then as a runaway living in Naples; then as a college student trying to avert the suicidal impulses of her best friend. We plunge into the hidden yearnings and disappointments of her uncle; an art historian stuck in a dead marriage; who travels to Naples to extract Sasha from the city’s demimonde and experiences an epiphany of his own while staring at a sculpture of Orpheus and Eurydice in the Museo Nazionale. We meet Bennie Salazar at the melancholy nadir of his adult life—divorced; struggling to connect with his nine-year-old son; listening to a washed-up band in the basement of a suburban house—and then revisit him in 1979; at the height of his youth; shy and tender; reveling in San Francisco’s punk scene as he discovers his ardor for rock and roll and his gift for spotting talent. We learn what became of his high school gang—who thrived and who faltered—and we encounter Lou Kline; Bennie’s catastrophically careless mentor; along with the lovers and children left behind in the wake of Lou’s far-flung sexual conquests and meteoric rise and fall. A Visit from the Goon Squad is a book about the interplay of time and music; about survival; about the stirrings and transformations set inexorably in motion by even the most passing conjunction of our fates. In a breathtaking array of styles and tones ranging from tragedy to satire to PowerPoint; Egan captures the undertow of self-destruction that we all must either master or succumb to; the basic human hunger for redemption; and the universal tendency to reach for both—and escape the merciless progress of time—in the transporting realms of art and music. Sly; startling; exhilarating work from one of our boldest writers.,3.67,179145,17909,memoir,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7331435-a-visit-from-the-goon-squad

 Heavier Than Heaven A Biography of Kurt Cobain,Charles R. Cross,"The art of Nirvana's Kurt Cobain was all about his private life; but written in a code as obscure as T.S. Eliot's. Now Charles Cross has cracked the code in the definitive biography Heavier Than Heaven; an all-access pass to Cobain's heart and mind. It reveals many secrets; thanks to 400-plus interviews; and even quotes Cobain's diaries and suicide notes and reveals an unreleased Nirvana masterpiece. At last we know how he created; how lies helped him die; how his family and love life entwined his art--plus; what the heck ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" really means. (It was graffiti by Bikini Kill's Kathleen Hanna after a double date with Dave Grohl; Cobain; and the ""over-bored and self-assured"" Tobi Vail; who wore Teen Spirit perfume; Hanna wrote it to taunt the emotionally clingy Cobain for wearing Vail's scent after sex--a violation of the no-strings-attached dating ethos of the Olympia; Washington; ""outcast teen"" underground. Cobain's stomach-churning passion for Vail erupted in six or so hit tunes like ""Aneurysm"" and ""Drain You."")  Cross uncovers plenty of news; mostly grim and gripping. As a teen; Cobain said he had ""suicide genes;"" and his clan was peculiarly defiant: one of his suicidal relatives stabbed his own belly in front of his family; then ripped apart the wound in the hospital. Cobain was contradictory: a sweet; popular teen athlete and sinister berserker; a kid who rescued injured pigeons and laughingly killed a cat; a talented yet astoundingly morbid visual artist. He grew up to be a millionaire who slept in cars (and stole one); a fiercely loyal man who ruthlessly screwed his oldest; best friends. In fact; his essence was contradictions barely contained. Cross; the coauthor of Nevermind: Nirvana; the definitive book about the making of the classic album; puts numerous Cobain-generated myths to rest. (Cobain never lived under a bridge--that Aberdeen bridge immortalized in the 12th song on Nevermind was a tidal slough; so nobody could sleep under it.) He gives the fullest account yet of what it was like to be; or love; Kurt Cobain. Heavier Than Heaven outshines the also indispensable Come As You Are. It's the deepest book about pop's darkest falling star. --Tim Appelo ",4.07,26575,1012,memoir,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1149440.Heavier_Than_Heaven

 Clapton The Autobiography,Eric Clapton,I found a pattern in my behavior that had been repeating itself for years; decades even. Bad choices were my specialty; and if something honest and decent came along; I would shun it or run the other way.”With striking intimacy and candor; Eric Clapton tells the story of his eventful and inspiring life in this poignant and honest autobiography. More than a rock star; he is an icon; a living embodiment of the history of rock music. Well known for his reserve in a profession marked by self-promotion; flamboyance; and spin; he now chronicles; for the first time; his remarkable personal and professional journeys. Born illegitimate in 1945 and raised by his grandparents; Eric never knew his father and; until the age of nine; believed his actual mother to be his sister. In his early teens his solace was the guitar; and his incredible talent would make him a cult hero in the clubs of Britain and inspire devoted fans to scrawl “Clapton is God” on the walls of London’s Underground. With the formation of Cream; the world's first supergroup; he became a worldwide superstar; but conflicting personalities tore the band apart within two years. His stints in Blind Faith; in Delaney and Bonnie and Friends; and in Derek and the Dominos were also short-lived but yielded some of the most enduring songs in history; including the classic “Layla.” During the late sixties he played as a guest with Jimi Hendrix and Bob Dylan; as well as the Beatles; the Rolling Stones; and longtime friend George Harrison. It was while working with the latter that he fell for George’s wife; Pattie Boyd; a seemingly unrequited love that led him to the depths of despair; self-imposed seclusion; and drug addiction. By the early seventies he had overcome his addiction and released the bestselling album 461 Ocean Boulevard; with its massive hit “I Shot the Sheriff.” He followed that with the platinum album Slowhand; which included “Wonderful Tonight;” the touching love song to Pattie; whom he finally married at the end of 1979. A short time later; however; Eric had replaced heroin with alcohol as his preferred vice; following a pattern of behavior that not only was detrimental to his music but contributed to the eventual breakup of his marriage. In the eighties he would battle and begin his recovery from alcoholism and become a father. But just as his life was coming together; he was struck by a terrible blow: His beloved four-year-old son; Conor; died in a freak accident. At an earlier time Eric might have coped with this tragedy by fleeing into a world of addiction. But now a much stronger man; he took refuge in music; responding with the achingly beautiful “Tears in Heaven.”Clapton is the powerfully written story of a survivor; a man who has achieved the pinnacle of success despite extraordinary demons. It is one of the most compelling memoirs of our time.,3.81,25024,1475,memoir,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1207904.Clapton

 Hammer of the Gods,Stephen Davis,They were legends based on mythsâ€”myths of fantasy; power; and black magic.

As soon as he could string chords and a solo together; Slash wanted to be in a band and sought out friends with similar interests. His closest friend; Steven Adler; proved to be a conspirator for the long haul. As hairmetal bands exploded onto the L.A. scene and topped the charts; Slash sought his niche and a band that suited his raw and gritty sensibility.He found salvation in the form of four young men of equal mind: Axl Rose; Izzy Stradlin; Steven Adler; and Duff McKagan. Together they became Guns N' Roses; one of the greatest rock 'n' roll bands of all time. Dirty; volatile; and as authentic as the streets that weaned them; they fought their way to the top with groundbreaking albums such as the iconic Appetite for Destruction and Use Your Illusion I and II.Here; for the first time ever; Slash tells the tale that has yet to be told from the inside: how the band came together; how they wrote the music that defined an era; how they survived insane; never-ending tours; how they survived themselves; and; ultimately; how it all fell apart. This is a window onto the world of the notoriously private guitarist and a seat on the roller-coaster ride that was one of history's greatest rock 'n' roll machines; always on the edge of self-destruction; even at the pinnacle of its success. This is a candid recollection and reflection of Slash's friendships past and present; from easygoing Izzy to ever-steady Duff to wild-child Steven and complicated Axl.It is also an intensely personal account of struggle and triumph: as Guns N' Roses journeyed to the top; Slash battled his demons; escaping the overwhelming reality with women; heroin; coke; crack; vodka; and whatever else came along.He survived it all: lawsuits; rehab; riots; notoriety; debauchery; and destruction; and ultimately found his creative evolution. From Slash's Snakepit to his current band; the massively successful Velvet Revolver;Slash found an even keel by sticking to his guns.Slash is everything the man; the myth; the legend; inspires: it's funny; honest; inspiring; jaw-dropping . . . and; in a word; excessive.,3.98,24356,1122,memoir,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1970449.Slash

 The History of Jazz,Ted Gioia,"Jazz is the most colorful and varied art form in the world and it was born in one of the most colorful and varied cities; New Orleans. From the seed first planted by slave dances held in Congo Square and nurtured by early ensembles led by Buddy Belden and Joe ""King"" Oliver; jazz began its long winding odyssey across America and around the world; giving flower to a thousand different forms--swing; bebop; cool jazz; jazz-rock fusion--and a thousand great musicians. Now; in The History of Jazz; Ted Gioia tells the story of this music as it has never been told before; in a book that brilliantly portrays the legendary jazz players; the breakthrough styles; and the world in which it evolved. Here are the giants of jazz and the great moments of jazz history--Jelly Roll Morton (""the world's greatest hot tune writer""); Louis Armstrong (whose O-keh recordings of the mid-1920s still stand as the most significant body of work that jazz has produced); Duke Ellington at the Cotton Club; cool jazz greats such as Gerry Mulligan; Stan Getz; and Lester Young; Charlie Parker's surgical precision of attack; Miles Davis's 1955 performance at the Newport Jazz Festival; Ornette Coleman's experiments with atonality; Pat Metheny's visionary extension of jazz-rock fusion; the contemporary sounds of Wynton Marsalis; and the post-modernists of the Knitting Factory. Gioia provides the reader with lively portraits of these and many other great musicians; intertwined with vibrant commentary on the music they created. Gioia also evokes the many worlds of jazz; taking the reader to the swamp lands of the Mississippi Delta; the bawdy houses of New Orleans; the rent parties of Harlem; the speakeasies of Chicago during the Jazz Age; the after hours spots of corrupt Kansas city; the Cotton Club; the Savoy; and the other locales where the history of jazz was made. And as he traces the spread of this protean form; Gioia provides much insight into the social context in which the music was born. He shows for instance how the development of technology helped promote the growth of jazz--how ragtime blossomed hand-in-hand with the spread of parlor and player pianos; and how jazz rode the growing popularity of the record industry in the 1920s. We also discover how bebop grew out of the racial unrest of the 1940s and '50s; when black players; no longer content with being ""entertainers;"" wanted to be recognized as practitioners of a serious musical form. Jazz is a chameleon art; delighting us with the ease and rapidity with which it changes colors. Now; in Ted Gioia's The History of Jazz; we have at last a book that captures all these colors on one glorious palate. Knowledgeable; vibrant; and comprehensive; it is among the small group of books that can truly be called classics of jazz literature.",4.06,3828,125,memoir,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/177539.The_History_of_Jazz

 Last Train to Memphis The Rise of Elvis Presley,Peter Guralnick,"From the moment that he first shook up the world in the mid 1950s; Elvis Presley has been one of the most vivid and enduring myths of American culture.Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley is the first biography to go past that myth and present an Elvis beyond the legend. Based on hundreds of interviews and nearly a decade of research; it traces the evolution not just of the man but of the music and of the culture he left utterly transformed; creating a completely fresh portrait of Elvis and his world.This volume tracks the first twenty-four years of Elvis' life; covering his childhood; the stunning first recordings at Sun Records (""That's All Right;"" ""Mystery Train""); and the early RCA hits (""Heartbreak Hotel;"" ""Hound Dog;"" ""Don't Be Cruel""). These were the years of his improbable self-invention and unprecedented triumphs; when it seemed that everything that Elvis tried succeeded wildly. There was scarcely a cloud in sight through this period until; in 1958; he was drafted into the army and his mother died shortly thereafter. The book closes on that somber and poignant note.Last Train to Memphis takes us deep inside Elvis' life; exploring his lifelong passion for music of every sort (from blues and gospel to Bing Crosby and Mario Lanza); his compelling affection for his family; and his intimate relationships with girlfriends; mentors; band members; professional associates; and friends. It shows us the loneliness; the trustfulness; the voracious appetite for experience; and above all the unshakable; almost mystical faith that Elvis had in himself and his music. Drawing frequently on Elvis' own words and on the recollections of those closest to him; the book offers an emotional; complex portrait of young Elvis Presley with a depth and dimension that for the first time allow his extraordinary accomplishments to ring true.Peter Guralnick has given us a previously unseen world; a rich panoply of people and events that illuminate an achievement; a place; and a time as never revealed before. Written with grace; humor; and affection; Last Train to Memphis has been hailed as the definitive biography of Elvis Presley. It is the first to set aside the myths and focus on Elvis' humanity in a way that has yet to be duplicated.",4.07,7712,394,memoir,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/712665.Last_Train_to_Memphis

Three little boys walking in the zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two. Two little boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was one. One little boy left all alone; He went out and hanged himself and then there were none.""When they realize that murders are occurring as described in the rhyme; terror mounts. One by one they fall prey. Before the weekend is out; there will be none. Who has choreographed this dastardly scheme? And who will be left to tell the tale?

 The Hound of the Baskervilles,Arthur Conan Doyle,"We owe The Hound of the Baskervilles (1902) to Arthur Conan Doyle's good friend Fletcher ""Bobbles"" Robinson; who took him to visit some scary English moors and prehistoric ruins; and told him marvelous local legends about escaped prisoners and a 17th-century aristocrat who fell afoul of the family dog. Doyle transmogrified the legend: generations ago; a hound of hell tore out the throat of devilish Hugo Baskerville on the moonlit moor. Poor; accursed Baskerville Hall now has another mysterious death: that of Sir Charles Baskerville. Could the culprit somehow be mixed up with secretive servant Barrymore; history-obsessed Dr. Frankland; butterfly-chasing Stapleton; or Selden; the Notting Hill murderer at large? Someone's been signaling with candles from the mansion's windows. Nor can supernatural forces be ruled out. Can Dr. Watson--left alone by Sherlock Holmes to sleuth in fear for much of the novel--save the next Baskerville; Sir Henry; from the hound's fangs? Many Holmes fans prefer Doyle's complete short stories; but their clockwork logic doesn't match the author's boast about this novel: it's ""a real Creeper!"" What distinguishes this particular Hound is its fulfillment of Doyle's great debt to Edgar Allan Poe--it's full of ancient woe; low moans; a Grimpen Mire that sucks ponies to Dostoyevskian deaths; and locals digging up Neolithic skulls without next-of-kins' consent. ""The longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one's soul;"" Watson realizes. ""Rank reeds and lush; slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay ... while a false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark; quivering mire; which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet ... it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths.""

 The Thirteenth Tale,Diane Setterfield,All children mythologize their birth...So begins the prologue of reclusive author Vida Winter's collection of stories; which are as famous for the mystery of the missing thirteenth tale as they are for the delight and enchantment of the twelve that do exist. The enigmatic Winter has spent six decades creating various outlandish life histories for herself -- all of them inventions that have brought her fame and fortune but have kept her violent and tragic past a secret. Now old and ailing; she at last wants to tell the truth about her extraordinary life.

Struck by a curious parallel between Miss Winter's story and her own; Margaret takes on the commission. As Vida disinters the life she meant to bury for good; Margaret is mesmerized. It is a tale of gothic strangeness featuring the Angelfield family; including the beautiful and willful Isabelle; the feral twins Adeline and Emmeline; a ghost; a governess; a topiary garden and a devastating fire.

 Sapiens A Brief History of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari,100;000 years ago; at least six human species inhabited the earth. Today there is just one. Us. Homo sapiens. How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods; nations and human rights; to trust money; books and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy; timetables and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? In Sapiens; Dr Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history; from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical – and sometimes devastating – breakthroughs of the Cognitive; Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology; anthropology; paleontology and economics; he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies; the animals and plants around us; and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors? And what; if anything; can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come?

 Quiet The Power of Introverts in a World That Cant Stop Talking,Susan Cain,The book that started the Quiet RevolutionAt least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introverts—Rosa Parks; Chopin; Dr. Seuss; Steve Wozniak—that we owe many of the great contributions to society. In Quiet; Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts—from a witty; high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks; to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Passionately argued; superbly researched; and filled with indelible stories of real people; Quiet has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and; equally important; how they see themselves.Now with Extra Libris material; including a reader’s guide and bonus content.,4.06,337592,24119,mystery,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8520610-quiet
 The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,Rebecca Skloot,Her name was Henrietta Lacks; but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors; yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture; they are still alive today; though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale; they’d weigh more than 50 million metric tons—as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer; viruses; and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization; cloning; and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions.Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown; buried in an unmarked grave.Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey; from the “colored” ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta’s small; dying hometown of Clover; Virginia — a land of wooden slave quarters; faith healings; and voodoo — to East Baltimore today; where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells.Henrietta’s family did not learn of her “immortality” until more than twenty years after her death; when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials; her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows; the story of the Lacks family — past and present — is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans; the birth of bioethics; and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.Over the decade it took to uncover this story; Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family—especially Henrietta’s daughter Deborah; who was devastated to learn about her mother’s cells. She was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space? What happened to her sister; Elsie; who died in a mental institution at the age of fifteen? And if her mother was so important to medicine; why couldn’t her children afford health insurance?Intimate in feeling; astonishing in scope; and impossible to put down; The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery; as well as its human consequences.,4.07,604642,35072,mystery,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6493208-the-immortal-life-of-henrietta-lacks
 Freakonomics A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything,Steven D. Levitt,Which is more dangerous; a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? Freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple; unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.Through forceful storytelling and wry insight; Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is; at root; the study of incentives -- how people get what they want; or need; especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics; they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well; everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world; despite a surfeit of obfuscation; complication; and downright deceit; is not impenetrable; is not unknowable; and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt; through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking; shows how to see through all the clutter.Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work; then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.(front flap),3.98,727623,16532,mystery,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1202.Freakonomics
 Educated,Tara Westover,"Tara Westover was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho; she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her ""head-for-the-hills bag"". In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother; a midwife and healer; and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard.Her father forbade hospitals; so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions; even burns from explosions; were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.Then; lacking any formal education; Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University; where she studied history; learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her; taking her over oceans and across continents; to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far; if there was still a way home.Educated is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers; Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.Librarian's note: An alternate cover edition can be found here",4.46,872763,72650,mystery,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35133922-educated
 The Devil in the White City Murder; Magic; and Madness at the Fair That Changed America,Erik Larson,"Author Erik Larson imbues the incredible events surrounding the 1893 Chicago World's Fair with such drama that readers may find themselves checking the book's categorization to be sure that 'The Devil in the White City' is not; in fact; a highly imaginative novel. Larson tells the stories of two men: Daniel H. Burnham; the architect responsible for the fair's construction; and H.H. Holmes; a serial killer masquerading as a charming doctor. Burnham's challenge was immense. In a short period of time; he was forced to overcome the death of his partner and numerous other obstacles to construct the famous ""White City"" around which the fair was built. His efforts to complete the project; and the fair's incredible success; are skillfully related along with entertaining appearances by such notables as Buffalo Bill Cody; Susan B. Anthony; and Thomas Edison. The activities of the sinister Dr. Holmes; who is believed to be responsible for scores of murders around the time of the fair; are equally remarkable. He devised and erected the World's Fair Hotel; complete with crematorium and gas chamber; near the fairgrounds and used the event as well as his own charismatic personality to lure victims. Combining the stories of an architect and a killer in one book; mostly in alternating chapters; seems like an odd choice but it works. The magical appeal and horrifying dark side of 19th-century Chicago are both revealed through Larson's skillful writing. - John Moe",3.99,541411,33309,mystery,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/397483.The_Devil_in_the_White_City

 Blink The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,Malcolm Gladwell,"Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology and displaying all of the brilliance that made The Tipping Point a classic; Blink changes the way you'll understand every decision you make. Never again will you think about thinking the same way.Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now; in Blink; he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking; about choices that seem to be made in an instant - in the blink of an eye - that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers; while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win; while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work - in the office; in the classroom; in the kitchen; and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?

Here; too; are great failures of ""blink"": the election of Warren Harding; ""New Coke""; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police.

 Between the World and Me,Ta-Nehisi Coates,“This is your country; this is your world; this is your body; and you must find some way to live within the all of it.” In a profound work that pivots from the biggest questions about American history and ideals to the most intimate concerns of a father for his son; Ta-Nehisi Coates offers a powerful new framework for understanding our nation’s history and current crisis. Americans have built an empire on the idea of “race;” a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men—bodies exploited through slavery and segregation; and; today; threatened; locked up; and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden?  Between the World and Me is Ta-Nehisi Coates’s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son.

On a May afternoon in 1943; an Army Air Forces bomber crashed into the Pacific Ocean and disappeared; leaving only a spray of debris and a slick of oil; gasoline; and blood. Then; on the ocean surface; a face appeared. It was that of a young lieutenant; the plane's bombardier; who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard. So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War.The lieutenant’s name was Louis Zamperini. In boyhood; he'd been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent; breaking into houses; brawling; and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager; he had channeled his defiance into running; discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile. But when war had come; the athlete had become an airman; embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight; a tiny raft; and a drift into the unknown.Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean; leaping sharks; a foundering raft; thirst and starvation; enemy aircraft; and; beyond; a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance; Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope; resolve; and humor; brutality with rebellion. His fate; whether triumph or tragedy; would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will.",4.36,789627,46650,mystery,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8664353-unbroken

Rex was a charismatic; brilliant man who; when sober; captured his children's imagination; teaching them physics; geology; and above all; how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary; who painted and wrote and couldn't stand the responsibility of providing for her family; called herself an ""excitement addict.""

Hers is a story of triumph against all odds; but also a tender; moving tale of unconditional love in a family that despite its profound flaws gave her the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms.

One day he was a doctor treating the dying; and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that; the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated.

 The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fck A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life,Mark Manson,"Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780062457738In this generation-defining self-help guide; a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be ""positive"" all the time so that we can truly become better; happier people.For decades; we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy; rich life.

The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling; let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation; rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.Manson makes the argument; backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes; that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade; but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—""not everybody can be extraordinary; there are winners and losers in society; and some of it is not fair or your fault."" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears; faults; and uncertainties; once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths; we can begin to find the courage; perseverance; honesty; responsibility; curiosity; and forgiveness we seek.There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter; Manson makes clear. While money is nice; caring about what you do with your life is better; because true wealth is about experience.

Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change; despite years of trying; while others seem to remake themselves overnight.

 The Omnivores Dilemma A Natural History of Four Meals,Michael Pollan,What should we have for dinner? For omnivore's like ourselves; this simple question has always posed a dilemma: When you can eat just about anything nature (or the supermarket) has to offer; deciding what you should eat will inevitably stir anxiety; especially when some of the foods on offer might shorten your life. Today; buffeted by one food fad after another; America is suffering from what can only be described as a national eating disorder. The omnivore's dilemma has returned with a vengeance; as the cornucopia of the modern American supermarket and fast-food outlet confronts us with a bewildering and treacherous food landscape. What's at stake in our eating choices is not only our own and our children's health; but the health of the environment that sustains life on earth.The Omnivore's Dilemma is a groundbreaking book in which one of America's most fascinating; original; and elegant writers turns his own omnivorous mind to the seemingly straightforward question of what we should have for dinner. The question has confronted us since man discovered fire; but; according to Michael Pollan; the bestselling author of The Botany of Desire; how we answer it today; ath the dawn of the twenty-first century; may well determine our very survival as a species. Should we eat a fast-food hamburger? Something organic> Or perhaps something we hunt; gather or grow ourselves?To find out; Pollan follows each of the food chains that sustain us--industrial food; organic or alternative food; and food we forage ourselves--from the source to a final meal; and in the process develops a definitive account of the American way of eating. His absorbing narrative takes us from Iowa cornfields to food laboratories; from feedlots and fast-food restaurants to organic farms and hunting grounds; always emphasizing our dynamic coevolutionary relationship with the handful of plant and animal species we depend on. Each time Pollan sits down to a meal; he deploys his unique blend of personal and investigative journalism to trace the origins of everything consumed; revealing what we unwittingly ingest and explaining how our taste for particular foods and flavors reflects our evolutionary inheritance.The surprising answers Pollan offers to the simple question posed by this book have profound political; economic; psychological; and even mortal implications for all of us. Ultimately; this is a book as much about visionary solutions as it is about problems; and Pollan contends that; when it comes to food; doing the right thing often turns out to be the tastiest thing an eater can do. Beautifully written and thrillingly argued; The Omnivore's Dilemma promises to change the way we think about the politics and pleasure of eating. For anyone who reads it; dinner will never again look; or taste; quite the same.--jacket,4.16,187462,12951,mystery,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3109.The_Omnivore_s_Dilemma

 Hillbilly Elegy A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis,J.D. Vance,Hillbilly Elegy is a passionate and personal analysis of a culture in crisis—that of white working-class Americans. The disintegration of this group; a process that has been slowly occurring now for more than forty years; has been reported with growing frequency and alarm; but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside. J. D. Vance tells the true story of what a social; regional; and class decline feels like when you were born with it hung around your neck.The Vance family story begins hopefully in postwar America. J. D.’s grandparents were “dirt poor and in love;” and moved north from Kentucky’s Appalachia region to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. They raised a middle-class family; and eventually one of their grandchildren would graduate from Yale Law School; a conventional marker of success in achieving generational upward mobility. But as the family saga of Hillbilly Elegy plays out; we learn that J.D.'s grandparents; aunt; uncle; sister; and; most of all; his mother struggled profoundly with the demands of their new middle-class life; never fully escaping the legacy of abuse; alcoholism; poverty; and trauma so characteristic of their part of America. With piercing honesty; Vance shows how he himself still carries around the demons of his chaotic family history.A deeply moving memoir; with its share of humor and vividly colorful figures; Hillbilly Elegy is the story of how upward mobility really feels. And it is an urgent and troubling meditation on the loss of the American dream for a large segment of this country.,3.92,322886,29004,mystery,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27161156-hillbilly-elegy
 The God Delusion,Richard Dawkins,A preeminent scientist - and the world's most prominent atheist - asserts the irrationality of belief in God; and the grievous harm religion has inflicted on society; from the Crusades to 9/11.With rigor and wit; Dawkins examines God in all his forms; from the sex-obsessed tyrant of the Old Testament; to the more benign (but still illogical) Celestial Watchmaker favored by some Enlightenment thinkers. He eviscerates the major arguments for religion; and demonstrates the supreme improbability of a supreme being. He shows how religion fuels war; foments bigotry; and abuses children; buttressing his points with historical and contemporary evidence.The God Delusion makes a compelling case that belief in God is not just wrong; but potentially deadly. It also offers exhilarating insight into the advantages of atheism to the individual and society; not the least of which is a clearer; truer appreciation of the universe's wonders than any faith could ever muster.,3.89,238001,8414,mystery,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14743.The_God_Delusion

Dr. Oliver Sacks recounts the stories of patients struggling to adapt to often bizarre worlds of neurological disorder. Here are people who can no longer recognize everyday objects or those they love; who are stricken with violent tics or shout involuntary obscenities; who have been dismissed as autistic or retarded; yet are gifted with uncanny artistic or mathematical talents.

'My friend and I were arguing about what would happen if a bullet got struck by lightning; and we agreed that you should resolve it . . . ' He liked these questions so much that he started up What If. If your cells suddenly lost the power to divide; how long would you survive? How dangerous is it; really; to be in a swimming pool in a thunderstorm? If we hooked turbines to people exercising in gyms; how much power could we produce? What if everyone only had one soulmate?When (if ever) did the sun go down on the British empire?  How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?What would happen if the moon went away?In pursuit of answers; Munroe runs computer simulations; pores over stacks of declassified military research memos; solves differential equations; and consults with nuclear reactor operators. His responses are masterpieces of clarity and hilarity; studded with memorable cartoons and infographics. They often predict the complete annihilation of humankind; or at least a really big explosion. Far more than a book for geeks; WHAT IF: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions explains the laws of science in operation in a way that every intelligent reader will enjoy and feel much the smarter for having read.,4.14,132794,8767,mystery,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21413662-what-if-serious-scientific-answers-to-absurd-hypothetical-questions

 Under the Banner of Heaven,Jon Krakauer,"A Story of Violent FaithA multilayered; bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion; savage violence; polygamy; and unyielding faith. This is vintage Krakauer; an utterly compelling work of nonfiction that illuminates an otherwise confounding realm of human behavior.Jon Krakauer’s literary reputation rests on insightful chronicles of lives conducted at the outer limits. In Under The Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith; he shifts his focus from extremes of physical adventure to extremes of religious belief within our own borders. At the core of his book is an appalling double murder committed by two Mormon Fundamentalist brothers; Ron and Dan Lafferty; who insist they received a revelation from God commanding them to kill their blameless victims. Beginning with a meticulously researched account of this ""divinely inspired"" crime; Krakauer constructs a multilayered; bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion; savage violence; polygamy; and unyielding faith. Along the way; he uncovers a shadowy offshoot of America’s fastest-growing religion; and raises provocative questions about the nature of religious belief.Krakauer takes readers inside isolated communities in the American West; Canada; and Mexico; where some forty-thousand Mormon Fundamentalists believe the mainstream Mormon Church went unforgivably astray when it renounced polygamy. Defying both civil authorities and the Mormon establishment in Salt Lake City; the leaders of these outlaw sects are zealots who answer only to God. Marrying prodigiously and with virtual impunity (the leader of the largest fundamentalist church took seventy-five ""plural wives;"" several of whom were wed to him when they were fourteen or fifteen and he was in his eighties); fundamentalist prophets exercise absolute control over the lives of their followers; and preach that any day now the world will be swept clean in a hurricane of fire; sparing only their most obedient adherents.Weaving the story of the Lafferty brothers and their fanatical brethren with a clear-eyed look at Mormonism’s violent past; Krakauer examines the underbelly of the most successful homegrown faith in the United States; and finds a distinctly American brand of religious extremism. The result is vintage Krakauer; an utterly compelling work of nonfiction that illuminates an otherwise confounding realm of human behavior.",3.99,161647,10615,mystery,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10847.Under_the_Banner_of_Heaven

 The Odyssey,Homer,"Sing to me of the man; Muse; the man of twists and turnsdriven time and again off course; once he had plunderedthe hallowed heights of Troy.So begins Robert Fagles' magnificent translation of the Odyssey; which Jasper Griffin in The New York Times Review of Books hails as ""a distinguished achievement.""If the Iliad is the world's greatest war epic; then the Odyssey is literature's grandest evocation of everyman's journey though life. Odysseus' reliance on his wit and wiliness for survival in his encounters with divine and natural forces; during his ten-year voyage home to Ithaca after the Trojan War; is at once a timeless human story and an individual test of moral endurance. In the myths and legends that are retold here; Fagles has captured the energy and poetry of Homer's original in a bold; contemporary idiom; and given us an Odyssey to read aloud; to savor; and to treasure for its sheer lyrical mastery.Renowned classicist Bernard Knox's superb Introduction and textual commentary provide new insights and background information for the general reader and scholar alike; intensifying the strength of Fagles' translation.This is an Odyssey to delight both the classicist and the public at large; and to captivate a new generation of Homer's students.--Robert Fagles; winner of the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation and a 1996 Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters; presents us with Homer's best-loved and most accessible poem in a stunning new modern-verse translation.",3.77,879200,12663,non-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1381.The_Odyssey

 The Canterbury Tales,Geoffrey Chaucer,The procession that crosses Chaucer's pages is as full of life and as richly textured as a medieval tapestry. The Knight; the Miller; the Friar; the Squire; the Prioress; the Wife of Bath; and others who make up the cast of characters -- including Chaucer himself -- are real people; with human emotions and weaknesses. When it is remembered that Chaucer wrote in English at a time when Latin was the standard literary language across western Europe; the magnitude of his achievement is even more remarkable. But Chaucer's genius needs no historical introduction; it bursts forth from every page of The Canterbury Tales.If we trust the General Prologue; Chaucer intended that each pilgrim should tell two tales on the way to Canterbury and two tales on the way back. He never finished his enormous project and even the completed tales were not finally revised. Scholars are uncertain about the order of the tales. As the printing press had yet to be invented when Chaucer wrote his works; The Canterbury Tales has been passed down in several handwritten manuscripts.,3.51,192374,3432,non-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2696.The_Canterbury_Tales

 Thinking; Fast and Slow,Daniel Kahneman,In the highly anticipated Thinking; Fast and Slow; Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think.

 Quiet The Power of Introverts in a World That Cant Stop Talking,Susan Cain,The book that started the Quiet RevolutionAt least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introverts—Rosa Parks; Chopin; Dr. Seuss; Steve Wozniak—that we owe many of the great contributions to society. In Quiet; Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts—from a witty; high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks; to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Passionately argued; superbly researched; and filled with indelible stories of real people; Quiet has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and; equally important; how they see themselves.Now with Extra Libris material; including a reader’s guide and bonus content.,4.06,337592,24119,poetry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8520610-quiet
 Blink The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,Malcolm Gladwell,"Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology and displaying all of the brilliance that made The Tipping Point a classic; Blink changes the way you'll understand every decision you make. Never again will you think about thinking the same way.Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now; in Blink; he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking; about choices that seem to be made in an instant - in the blink of an eye - that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers; while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win; while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work - in the office; in the classroom; in the kitchen; and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last; based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here; too; are great failures of ""blink"": the election of Warren Harding; ""New Coke""; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating; but those who have perfected the art of ""thin-slicing"" - filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.",3.94,501537,15517,poetry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40102.Blink

The patterns inside her brain; neurologists discover; have fundamentally changed.Marketers at Procter & Gamble study videos of people making their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze; on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly; one of them detects a nearly imperceptible pattern—and with a slight shift in advertising; Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year.An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employees—how they approach worker safety—and soon the firm; Alcoa; becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones.What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives. They succeeded by transforming habits.In The Power of Habit; award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives; Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation. Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change; despite years of trying; while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where; exactly; they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps; Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz; and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King; Jr. We go inside Procter & Gamble; Target superstores; Rick Warren’s Saddleback Church; NFL locker rooms; and the nation’s largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success; life and death.At its core; The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly; losing weight; raising exceptional children; becoming more productive; building revolutionary companies and social movements; and achieving success is understanding how habits work.

 Predictably Irrational The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions,Dan Ariely,"Why do our headaches persist after taking a one-cent aspirin but disappear when we take a 50-cent aspirin?Why does recalling the Ten Commandments reduce our tendency to lie; even when we couldn't possibly be caught?Why do we splurge on a lavish meal but cut coupons to save twenty-five cents on a can of soup?Why do we go back for second helpings at the unlimited buffet; even when our stomachs are already full?And how did we ever start spending $4.15 on a cup of coffee when; just a few years ago; we used to pay less than a dollar?When it comes to making decisions in our lives; we think we're in control. We think we're making smart; rational choices. But are we?In a series of illuminating; often surprising experiments; MIT behavioral economist Dan Ariely refutes the common assumption that we behave in fundamentally rational ways. Blending everyday experience with groundbreaking research; Ariely explains how expectations; emotions; social norms; and other invisible; seemingly illogical forces skew our reasoning abilities.Not only do we make astonishingly simple mistakes every day; but we make the same ""types"" of mistakes; Ariely discovers. We consistently overpay; underestimate; and procrastinate. We fail to understand the profound effects of our emotions on what we want; and we overvalue what we already own. Yet these misguided behaviors are neither random nor senseless. They're systematic and predictable--making us ""predictably"" irrational.From drinking coffee to losing weight; from buying a car to choosing a romantic partner; Ariely explains how to break through these systematic patterns of thought to make better decisions. ""Predictably Irrational"" will change the way we interact with the world--one small decision at a time.",4.13,103941,5479,poetry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1713426.Predictably_Irrational

He analyzes fashion trends; smoking; children's television; direct mail; and the early days of the American Revolution for clues about making ideas infectious; and visits a religious commune; a successful high-tech company; and one of the world's greatest salesmen to show how to start and sustain social epidemics.,3.98,705781,13825,poetry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2612.The_Tipping_Point
 The Psychopath Test A Journey Through the Madness Industry,Jon Ronson,In this madcap journey; a bestselling journalist investigates psychopaths and the industry of doctors; scientists; and everyone else who studies them. The Psychopath Test is a fascinating journey through the minds of madness. Jon Ronson's exploration of a potential hoax being played on the world's top neurologists takes him; unexpectedly; into the heart of the madness industry. An influential psychologist who is convinced that many important CEOs and politicians are; in fact; psychopaths teaches Ronson how to spot these high-flying individuals by looking out for little telltale verbal and nonverbal clues. And so Ronson; armed with his new psychopath-spotting abilities; enters the corridors of power. He spends time with a death-squad leader institutionalized for mortgage fraud in Coxsackie; New York; a legendary CEO whose psychopathy has been speculated about in the press; and a patient in an asylum for the criminally insane who insists he's sane and certainly not a psychopath. Ronson not only solves the mystery of the hoax but also discovers; disturbingly; that sometimes the personalities at the helm of the madness industry are; with their drives and obsessions; as mad in their own way as those they study. And that relatively ordinary people are; more and more; defined by their maddest edges.,3.94,126109,7321,poetry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12391521-the-psychopath-test

 Mindset The New Psychology of Success,Carol S. Dweck,A newer edition of this book can be found here.After decades of research; world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol S. Dweck; Ph.D.; discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset. In this brilliant book; she shows how success in school; work; sports; the arts; and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a fixed mindset — those who believe that abilities are fixed — are less likely to flourish than those with a growth mindset — those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents; teachers; managers; and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment.In this edition; Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mindset and guides people toward adopting a deeper; truer growth mindset. She also expands the mindset concept beyond the individual; applying it to the cultures of groups and organizations. With the right mindset; you can motivate those you lead; teach; and love — to transform their lives and your own.,4.06,95175,7605,poetry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40745.Mindset

 The Body Keeps the Score Brain; Mind; and Body in the Healing of Trauma,Bessel A. van der Kolk,A pioneering researcher and one of the world’s foremost experts on traumatic stress offers a bold new paradigm for healing. Trauma is a fact of life. Veterans and their families deal with the painful aftermath of combat; one in five Americans has been molested; one in four grew up with alcoholics; one in three couples have engaged in physical violence. Such experiences inevitably leave traces on minds; emotions; and even on biology. Sadly; trauma sufferers frequently pass on their stress to their partners and children. Renowned trauma expert Bessel van der Kolk has spent over three decades working with survivors. In The Body Keeps the Score; he transforms our understanding of traumatic stress; revealing how it literally rearranges the brain’s wiring—specifically areas dedicated to pleasure; engagement; control; and trust. He shows how these areas can be reactivated through innovative treatments including neurofeedback; mindfulness techniques; play; yoga; and other therapies. Based on Dr. van der Kolk’s own research and that of other leading specialists; The Body Keeps the Score offers proven alternatives to drugs and talk therapy—and a way to reclaim lives.,4.46,45254,3823,poetry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693771-the-body-keeps-the-score
 The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fck A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life,Mark Manson,"Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780062457738In this generation-defining self-help guide; a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be ""positive"" all the time so that we can truly become better; happier people.For decades; we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy; rich life. ""F**k positivity;"" Mark Manson says. ""Let’s be honest; shit is f**ked and we have to live with it."" In his wildly popular Internet blog; Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw; refreshing; honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling; let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation; rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.Manson makes the argument; backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes; that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade; but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—""not everybody can be extraordinary; there are winners and losers in society; and some of it is not fair or your fault."" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears; faults; and uncertainties; once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths; we can begin to find the courage; perseverance; honesty; responsibility; curiosity; and forgiveness we seek.There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter; Manson makes clear. While money is nice; caring about what you do with your life is better; because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk; filled with entertaining stories and profane; ruthless humor; The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented; grounded lives.",3.93,573890,35516,poetry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28257707-the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck
 Man and His Symbols,C.G. Jung,Man and His Symbols owes its existence to one of Jung's own dreams. The great psychologist dreamed that his work was understood by a wide public; rather than just by psychiatrists; and therefore he agreed to write and edit this fascinating book. Here; Jung examines the full world of the unconscious; whose language he believed to be the symbols constantly revealed in dreams. Convinced that dreams offer practical advice; sent from the unconscious to the conscious self; Jung felt that self-understanding would lead to a full and productive life. Thus; the reader will gain new insights into himself from this thoughtful volume; which also illustrates symbols throughout history. Completed just before his death by Jung and his associates; it is clearly addressed to the general reader.,4.18,21454,785,poetry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123632.Man_and_His_Symbols
 12 Rules for Life An Antidote to Chaos,Jordan B. Peterson,What does everyone in the modern world need to know? Renowned psychologist Jordan B. Peterson's answer to this most difficult of questions uniquely combines the hard-won truths of ancient tradition with the stunning revelations of cutting-edge scientific research.Humorous; surprising; and informative; Dr. Peterson tells us why skateboarding boys and girls must be left alone; what terrible fate awaits those who criticize too easily; and why you should always pet a cat when you meet one on the street.What does the nervous system of the lowly lobster have to tell us about standing up straight (with our shoulders back) and about success in life? Why did ancient Egyptians worship the capacity to pay careful attention as the highest of gods? What dreadful paths do people tread when they become resentful; arrogant; and vengeful? Dr. Peterson journeys broadly; discussing discipline; freedom; adventure; and responsibility; distilling the world's wisdom into 12 practical and profound rules for life. 12 Rules for Life shatters the modern commonplaces of science; faith; and human nature while transforming and ennobling the mind and spirit of its listeners.,3.94,113236,9670,poetry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30257963-12-rules-for-life
 The Righteous Mind Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion,Jonathan Haidt,An alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780307377906 can be found here.Why can’t our political leaders work together as threats loom and problems mount? Why do people so readily assume the worst about the motives of their fellow citizens? In The Righteous Mind; social psychologist Jonathan Haidt explores the origins of our divisions and points the way forward to mutual understanding.  His starting point is moral intuition—the nearly instantaneous perceptions we all have about other people and the things they do. These intuitions feel like self-evident truths; making us righteously certain that those who see things differently are wrong. Haidt shows us how these intuitions differ across cultures; including the cultures of the political left and right. He blends his own research findings with those of anthropologists; historians; and other psychologists to draw a map of the moral domain. He then examines the origins of morality; overturning the view that evolution made us fundamentally selfish creatures. But rather than arguing that we are innately altruistic; he makes a more subtle claim—that we are fundamentally groupish. It is our groupishness; he explains; that leads to our greatest joys; our religious divisions; and our political affiliations. In a stunning final chapter on ideology and civility; Haidt shows what each side is right about; and why we need the insights of liberals; conservatives; and libertarians to flourish as a nation.,4.21,36548,4072,poetry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11324722-the-righteous-mind
 Stumbling on Happiness,Daniel Todd Gilbert,• Why are lovers quicker to forgive their partners for infidelity than for leaving dirty dishes in the sink? • Why will sighted people pay more to avoid going blind than blind people will pay to regain their sight? • Why do dining companions insist on ordering different meals instead of getting what they really want? • Why do pigeons seem to have such excellent aim; why can’t we remember one song while listening to another; and why does the line at the grocery store always slow down the moment we join it? In this brilliant; witty; and accessible book; renowned Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert describes the foibles of imagination and illusions of foresight that cause each of us to misconceive our tomorrows and misestimate our satisfactions. Vividly bringing to life the latest scientific research in psychology; cognitive neuroscience; philosophy; and behavioral economics; Gilbert reveals what scientists have discovered about the uniquely human ability to imagine the future; and about our capacity to predict how much we will like it when we get there. With penetrating insight and sparkling prose; Gilbert explains why we seem to know so little about the hearts and minds of the people we are about to become.,3.83,54509,2676,poetry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56627.Stumbling_on_Happiness
 The Lucifer Effect Understanding How Good People Turn Evil,Philip G. Zimbardo,"Renowned social psychologist and creator of the ""Stanford Prison Experiment;"" Philip Zimbardo explores the mechanisms that make good people do bad things; how moral people can be seduced into acting immorally; and what this says about the line separating good from evil.The Lucifer Effect explains how—and the myriad reasons why—we are all susceptible to the lure of “the dark side.” Drawing on examples from history as well as his own trailblazing research; Zimbardo details how situational forces and group dynamics can work in concert to make monsters out of decent men and women. Here; for the first time and in detail; Zimbardo tells the full story of the Stanford Prison Experiment; the landmark study in which a group of college-student volunteers was randomly divided into “guards” and “inmates” and then placed in a mock prison environment. Within a week; the study was abandoned; as ordinary college students were transformed into either brutal; sadistic guards or emotionally broken prisoners. By illuminating the psychological causes behind such disturbing metamorphoses; Zimbardo enables us to better understand a variety of harrowing phenomena; from corporate malfeasance to organized genocide to how once upstanding American soldiers came to abuse and torture Iraqi detainees in Abu Ghraib. He replaces the long-held notion of the “bad apple” with that of the “bad barrel”—the idea that the social setting and the system contaminate the individual; rather than the other way around.",3.93,19119,957,poetry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/359194.The_Lucifer_Effect
 Drive The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us,Daniel H. Pink,The New York Times bestseller that gives readers a paradigm-shattering new way to think about motivation Most people believe that the best way to motivate is with rewards like money—the carrot-and-stick approach. That's a mistake; says Daniel H. Pink (author of To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Motivating Others). In this provocative and persuasive new book; he asserts that the secret to high performance and satisfaction-at work; at school; and at home—is the deeply human need to direct our own lives; to learn and create new things; and to do better by ourselves and our world.Drawing on four decades of scientific research on human motivation; Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business does—and how that affects every aspect of life. He examines the three elements of true motivation—autonomy; mastery; and purpose-and offers smart and surprising techniques for putting these into action in a unique book that will change how we think and transform how we live.,3.95,97428,4477,poetry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6452796-drive

 Civilization and Its Discontents,Sigmund Freud,It stands as a brilliant summary of the views on culture from a psychoanalytic perspective that he had been developing since the turn of the century. It is both witness and tribute to the late theory of mind—the so-called structural theory; with its stress on aggression; indeed the death drive; as the pitiless adversary of eros.Civilization and Its Discontents is one of the last of Freud's books; written in the decade before his death and first published in German in 1929. In it he states his views on the broad question of man's place in the world; a place Freud defines in terms of ceaseless conflict between the individual's quest for freedom and society's demand for conformity.Freud's theme is that what works for civilization doesn't necessarily work for man. Man; by nature aggressive and egotistical; seeks self-satisfaction. But culture inhibits his instinctual drives. The result is a pervasive and familiar guilt.Of the various English translations of Freud's major works to appear in his lifetime; only one was authorized by Freud himself: The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud under the general editorship of James Strachey.Freud approved the overall editorial plan; specific renderings of key words and phrases; and the addition of valuable notes; from bibliographical and explanatory. Many of the translations were done by Strachey himself; the rest were prepared under his supervision. The result was to place the Standard Edition in a position of unquestioned supremacy over all other existing versions.,3.79,32791,1170,poetry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/357636.Civilization_and_Its_Discontents

 Daring Greatly How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live; Love; Parent; and Lead,Brené Brown,Researcher and thought leader Dr. Brené Brown offers a powerful new vision that encourages us to dare greatly: to embrace vulnerability and imperfection; to live wholeheartedly; and to courageously engage in our lives. “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles; or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; . . . who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement; and who at worst; if he fails; at least fails while daring greatly.” —Theodore RooseveltEvery day we experience the uncertainty; risks; and emotional exposure that define what it means to be vulnerable; or to dare greatly. Whether the arena is a new relationship; an important meeting; our creative process; or a difficult family conversation; we must find the courage to walk into vulnerability and engage with our whole hearts.In Daring Greatly; Dr. Brown challenges everything we think we know about vulnerability. Based on twelve years of research; she argues that vulnerability is not weakness; but rather our clearest path to courage; engagement; and meaningful connection. The book that Dr. Brown’s many fans have been waiting for; Daring Greatly will spark a new spirit of truth—and trust—in our organizations; families; schools; and communities.,4.26,139324,9310,poetry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13588356-daring-greatly
 Talking to Strangers What We Should Know About the People We Dont Know,Malcolm Gladwell,"Malcolm Gladwell; host of the podcast Revisionist History and author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Outliers; offers a powerful examination of our interactions with strangers -- and why they often go wrong.How did Fidel Castro fool the CIA for a generation? Why did Neville Chamberlain think he could trust Adolf Hitler? Why are campus sexual assaults on the rise? Do television sitcoms teach us something about the way we relate to each other that isn't true?While tackling these questions; Malcolm Gladwell was not solely writing a book for the page. He was also producing for the ear. In the audiobook version of Talking to Strangers; you'll hear the voices of people he interviewed--scientists; criminologists; military psychologists. Court transcripts are brought to life with re-enactments. You actually hear the contentious arrest of Sandra Bland by the side of the road in Texas. As Gladwell revisits the deceptions of Bernie Madoff; the trial of Amanda Knox; and the suicide of Sylvia Plath; you hear directly from many of the players in these real-life tragedies. There's even a theme song - Janelle Monae's ""Hell You Talmbout.""Something is very wrong; Gladwell argues; with the tools and strategies we use to make sense of people we don't know. And because we don't know how to talk to strangers; we are inviting conflict and misunderstanding in ways that have a profound effect on our lives and our world.",4.04,155296,14664,poetry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43848929-talking-to-strangers

 Nudge Improving Decisions About Health; Wealth; and Happiness,Richard H. Thaler, From the winner of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Economics; Richard H. Thaler; and Cass R. Sunstein: a revelatory look at how we make decisionsNew York Times bestsellerNamed a Best Book of the Year by The Economist and the Financial Times Every day we make choices—about what to buy or eat; about financial investments or our children’s health and education; even about the causes we champion or the planet itself. Unfortunately; we often choose poorly. Nudge is about how we make these choices and how we can make better ones. Using dozens of eye-opening examples and drawing on decades of behavioral science research; Nobel Prize winner Richard H. Thaler and Harvard Law School professor Cass R. Sunstein show that no choice is ever presented to us in a neutral way; and that we are all susceptible to biases that can lead us to make bad decisions. But by knowing how people think; we can use sensible “choice architecture” to nudge people toward the best decisions for ourselves; our families; and our society; without restricting our freedom of choice.,3.84,65102,3197,poetry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3450744-nudge
 Grit The Power of Passion and Perseverance,Angela Duckworth,In this must-read book for anyone striving to succeed; pioneering psychologist Angela Duckworth shows parents; educators; students; and business people both seasoned and new that the secret to outstanding achievement is not talent but a focused persistence called grit.Why do some people succeed and others fail? Sharing new insights from her landmark research on grit; Angela Duckworth explains why talent is hardly a guarantor of success. Rather; other factors can be even more crucial such as identifying our passions and following through on our commitments.Drawing on her own powerful story as the daughter of a scientist who frequently bemoaned her lack of smarts; Duckworth describes her winding path through teaching; business consulting; and neuroscience; which led to the hypothesis that what really drives success is not genius; but a special blend of passion and long-term perseverance. As a professor at the University of Pennsylvania; Duckworth created her own character lab and set out to test her theory.Here; she takes readers into the field to visit teachers working in some of the toughest schools; cadets struggling through their first days at West Point; and young finalists in the National Spelling Bee. She also mines fascinating insights from history and shows what can be gleaned from modern experiments in peak performance. Finally; she shares what she's learned from interviewing dozens of high achievers; from JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon to the cartoon editor of The New Yorker to Seattle Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll.Winningly personal; insightful; and even life-changing; Grit is a book about what goes through your head when you fall down; and how that not talent or luck makes all the difference.,4.08,74466,5784,poetry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27213329-grit
 The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People Powerful Lessons in Personal Change,Stephen R. Covey,When Stephen Covey first released The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People; the book became an instant rage because people suddenly got up and took notice that their lives were headed off in the wrong direction; and more than that; they realized that there were so many simple things they could do in order to navigate their life correctly. This book was wonderful education for people; education in how to live life effectively and get closer to the ideal of being a ‘success’ in life.But not everyone understands Stephen Covey’s model fully well; or maybe there are some people who haven’t read it yet. This is definitely true because we still see so much failure all around us. Now; I am not saying that by using Covey’s model; or anyone else’s model for that matter; you can become a sure-shot success; but at least we should have seen many more successes around us already judging by the number of copies the book has sold! So; where is the shortcoming?There are two main problems here; and we are talking only about the people who have read the book already. The first problem is that most people are too lazy to implement the ideals of Stephen Covey in their lives. They consider his masterpiece of a book as a mere coffee-table book or a book that you use for light reading when you are traveling and then forget all about it. They do not realize that this book contains life-changing information. Or; they take the information and do not make the effort to actually utilize it so that it becomes knowledge for them.The second problem is that a lot of people have a myopic view of Covey’s ideals. These are people who are impressed by the book already. If you ask them what the seven habits are; they can rattle them off end to end; but then they miss the larger picture. They do not understand that Covey was trying to tell more than he wrote in words. There are hidden implications in this book; yes; and a lot of people have just failed to see through them.That is what we are trying to do. We are trying to show you how Covey’s book; or rather; his model; was a complete model in itself. There was nothing amiss about it. If you implement it; there should be no aspect of your life that should go untouched. The only thing is that you have to understand these ideals and try to implement them in your life.But; before we barge into that area; it is extremely important to understand what these ideals are. What was the model that was propounded by Stephen Covey in his mega-famous book? We shall begin by trying to understand his model first; and then interpret it in such a way that it pertains to every aspect of our life,4.12,545844,10823,poetry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36072.The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People
 The Blank Slate The Modern Denial of Human Nature,Steven Pinker,In The Blank Slate; Steven Pinker explores the idea of human nature and its moral; emotional; and political colorings. He shows how many intellectuals have denied the existence of human nature by embracing three linked dogmas: the Blank Slate (the mind has no innate traits); the Noble Savage (people are born good and corrupted by society); and the Ghost in the Machine (each of us has a soul that makes choices free from biology). Each dogma carries a moral burden; so their defenders have engaged in desperate tactics to discredit the scientists who are now challenging them.Pinker injects calm and rationality into these debates by showing that equality; progress; responsibility; and purpose have nothing to fear from discoveries about a rich human nature. He disarms even the most menacing threats with clear thinking; common sense; and pertinent facts from science and history.Despite its popularity among intellectuals during much of the twentieth century; he argues; the doctrine of the Blank Slate may have done more harm than good. It denies our common humanity and our individual preferences; replaces hardheaded analyses of social problems with feel-good slogans; and distorts our understanding of government; violence; parenting; and the arts.Pinker shows that an acknowledgement of human nature that is grounded in science and common sense; far from being dangerous; can complement insights about the human condition made by millennia of artists and philosophers. All this is done in the style that earned his previous books many prizes and worldwide acclaim: wit; lucidity; and insight into matters great and small.,4.08,21831,922,poetry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5752.The_Blank_Slate
 The Willpower Instinct How Self-Control Works; Why It Matters; and What You Can Do to Get More of It,Kelly McGonigal,"The first book to explain the new science of self-control and how it can be harnessed to improve our health; happiness; and productivity.After years of watching her students struggling with their choices; health psychologist Kelly McGonigal; Ph.D.; realized that much of what people believe about willpower is actually sabotaging their success. Committed to sharing what the scientific community already knew about self-control; McGonigal created a course called ""The Science of Willpower"" for Stanford University's Continuing Studies Program. The course was an instant hit and spawned the hugely successful Psychology Today blog with the same name.Informed by the latest research and combining cutting-edge insights from psychology; economics; neuroscience; and medicine; McGonigal's book explains exactly what willpower is; how it works; and why it matters. Readers will learn:Willpower is a mind-body response; not a virtue. It is a biological function that can be improved through mindfulness; exercise; nutrition; and sleep. People who have better control of their attention; emotions; and actions are healthier; happier; have more satisfying relationships; and make more money. Willpower is not an unlimited resource. Too much self-control can actually be bad for your health. Temptation and stress hijack the brain's systems of self-control; and that the brain can be trained for greater willpower.In the groundbreaking tradition of Getting Things Done; The Willpower Instinct combines life-changing prescriptive advice and complementary exercises to help readers with goals ranging from a healthier life to more patient parenting; from greater productivity at work to finally finishing the basement.",4.14,27182,1831,poetry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10865206-the-willpower-instinct
 The Road Less Traveled A New Psychology of Love; Traditional Values and Spiritual Growth,M. Scott Peck,"The Road Less Traveled: A New Psychology of Love; Traditional Values and Spiritual Growth316 pp. ""Psychotherapy is all things to all people in this mega-selling pop-psychology watershed; which features a new introduction by the author in this 25th anniversary edition. His agenda in this tome; which was first published in 1978 but didn't become a bestseller until 1983; is to reconcile the psychoanalytic tradition with the conflicting cultural currents roiling the 70s. In the spirit of Me-Decade individualism and libertinism; he celebrates self-actualization as life's highest purpose and flirts with the notions of open marriage and therapeutic sex between patient and analyst. But because he is attuned to the nascent conservative backlash against the therapeutic worldview; Peck also cites Gospel passages; recruits psychotherapy to the cause of traditional religion (he even convinces a patient to sign up for divinity school) and insists that problems must be overcome through suffering; discipline and hard work (with a therapist.) Often departing from the cerebral and rationalistic bent of Freudian discourse for a mystical; Jungian tone more compatible with New Age spirituality; Peck writes of psychotherapy as an exercise in ""love"" and ""spiritual growth;"" asserts that ""our unconscious is God"" and affirms his belief in miracles; reincarnation and telepathy. Peck's synthesis of such clashing elements (he even throws in a little thermodynamics) is held together by a warm and lucid discussion of psychiatric principles and moving accounts of his own patients' struggles and breakthroughs. Harmonizing psychoanalysis and spirituality; Christ and Buddha; Calvinist work ethic and interminable talking cures; this book is a touchstone of our contemporary religio-therapeutic culture."" -- Publishers WeeklyKeywords: MIND & BODY PSYCHOLOGY SOCIOLOGY RELIGION",4.06,85521,2484,poetry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/347852.The_Road_Less_Traveled
 The Gifts of Imperfection,Brené Brown,New York Times best-selling author and professor Brené Brown offers a powerful and inspiring book that explores how to cultivate the courage; compassion; and connection to embrace your imperfections and to recognize that you are enough.Each day we face a barrage of images and messages from society and the media telling us who; what; and how we should be. We are led to believe that if we could only look perfect and lead perfect lives; we'd no longer feel inadequate. So most of us perform; please; and perfect; all the while thinking; What if I can't keep all of these balls in the air? Why isn't everyone else working harder and living up to my expectations? What will people think if I fail or give up? When can I stop proving myself?In The Gifts of Imperfection; Bren頂rown; PhD; a leading expert on shame; authenticity and belonging; shares what she's learned from a decade of research on the power of Wholehearted Living--a way of engaging with the world from a place of worthiness.In her ten guideposts; Brown engages our minds; hearts; and spirits as she explores how we can cultivate the courage; compassion; and connection to wake up in the morning and think; No matter what gets done and how much is left undone; I am enough; and to go to bed at night thinking; Yes; I am sometimes afraid; but I am also brave. And; yes; I am imperfect and vulnerable; but that doesn't change the truth that I am worthy of love and belonging.,4.20,118270,7164,poetry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7015403-the-gifts-of-imperfection
 Maybe You Should Talk to Someone A Therapist; Her Therapist; and Our Lives Revealed,Lori Gottlieb,From a New York Times best-selling author; psychotherapist; and national advice columnist; a hilarious; thought-provoking; and surprising new book that takes us behind the scenes of a therapist's world -- where her patients are looking for answers (and so is she). One day; Lori Gottlieb is a therapist who helps patients in her Los Angeles practice. The next; a crisis causes her world to come crashing down. Enter Wendell; the quirky but seasoned therapist in whose office she suddenly lands. With his balding head; cardigan; and khakis; he seems to have come straight from Therapist Central Casting. Yet he will turn out to be anything but. As Gottlieb explores the inner chambers of her patients' lives -- a self-absorbed Hollywood producer; a young newlywed diagnosed with a terminal illness; a senior citizen threatening to end her life on her birthday if nothing gets better; and a twenty-something who can't stop hooking up with the wrong guys -- she finds that the questions they are struggling with are the very ones she is now bringing to Wendell. With startling wisdom and humor; Gottlieb invites us into her world as both clinician and patient; examining the truths and fictions we tell ourselves and others as we teeter on the tightrope between love and desire; meaning and mortality; guilt and redemption; terror and courage; hope and change.Maybe You Should Talk to Someone is revolutionary in its candor; offering a deeply personal yet universal tour of our hearts and minds and providing the rarest of gifts: a boldly revealing portrait of what it means to be human; and a disarmingly funny and illuminating account of our own mysterious lives and our power to transform them.,4.37,141688,13019,poetry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37570546-maybe-you-should-talk-to-someone

 On Becoming a Person A Therapists View of Psychotherapy,Carl R. Rogers,"The late Carl Rogers; founder of the humanistic psychology movement; revolutionized psychotherapy with his concept of ""client-centered therapy."" His influence has spanned decades; but that influence has become so much a part of mainstream psychology that the ingenious nature of his work has almost been forgotten. A new introduction by Peter Kramer sheds light on the significance of Dr. Rogers's work today. New discoveries in the field of psychopharmacology; especially that of the antidepressant Prozac; have spawned a quick-fix drug revolution that has obscured the psychotherapeutic relationship. As the pendulum slowly swings back toward an appreciation of the therapeutic encounter; Dr. Rogers's ""client-centered therapy"" becomes particularly timely and important.",4.15,13828,330,poetry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174879.On_Becoming_a_Person

 How the Mind Works,Steven Pinker,"In this extraordinary bestseller; Steven Pinker; one of the world's leading cognitive scientists; does for the rest of the mind what he did for language in his 1994 book; The Language Instinct. He explains what the mind is; how it evolved; and how it allows us to see; think; feel; laugh; interact; enjoy the arts; and ponder the mysteries of life. And he does it with the wit that prompted Mark Ridley to write in the New York Times Book Review; ""No other science writer makes me laugh so much. . . . [Pinker] deserves the superlatives that are lavished on him.""  The arguments in the book are as bold as its title. Pinker rehabilitates some unfashionable ideas; such as that the mind is a computer and that human nature was shaped by natural selection; and challenges fashionable ones; such as that passionate emotions are irrational; that parents socialize their children; and that nature is good and modern society corrupting.

 The Sociopath Next Door,Martha Stout,"Who is the devil you know? Is it your lying; cheating ex-husband?Your sadistic high school gym teacher?Your boss who loves to humiliate people in meetings?The colleague who stole your idea and passed it off as her own?In the pages of The Sociopath Next Door; you will realize that your ex was not just misunderstood. He’s a sociopath. And your boss; teacher; and colleague? They may be sociopaths too.We are accustomed to think of sociopaths as violent criminals; but in The Sociopath Next Door; Harvard psychologist Martha Stout reveals that a shocking 4 percent of ordinary people—one in twenty-five—has an often undetected mental disorder; the chief symptom of which is that that person possesses no conscience. He or she has no ability whatsoever to feel shame; guilt; or remorse. One in twenty-five everyday Americans; therefore; is secretly a sociopath. They could be your colleague; your neighbor; even family. And they can do literally anything at all and feel absolutely no guilt. 

How do we recognize the remorseless? One of their chief characteristics is a kind of glow or charisma that makes sociopaths more charming or interesting than the other people around them. They’re more spontaneous; more intense; more complex; or even sexier than everyone else; making them tricky to identify and leaving us easily seduced. Fundamentally; sociopaths are different because they cannot love. Sociopaths learn early on to show sham emotion; but underneath they are indifferent to others’ suffering. They live to dominate and thrill to win. The fact is; we all almost certainly know at least one or more sociopaths already. Part of the urgency in reading The Sociopath Next Door is the moment when we suddenly recognize that someone we know—someone we worked for; or were involved with; or voted for—is a sociopath. But what do we do with that knowledge? To arm us against the sociopath; Dr. Stout teaches us to question authority; suspect flattery; and beware the pity play. Above all; she writes; when a sociopath is beckoning; do not join the game. It is the ruthless versus the rest of us; and The Sociopath Next Door will show you how to recognize and defeat the devil you know.",3.76,32646,2456,poetry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72536.The_Sociopath_Next_Door

 The Paradox of Choice Why More Is Less,Barry Schwartz,About the Book: The Paradox of Choice. In the spirit of Alvin Tofflers Future Shock; a social critique of our obsession with choice; and how it contributes to anxiety; dissatisfaction and regret. Whether we're buying a pair of jeans; ordering a cup of coffee; selecting a long-distance carrier; applying to college; choosing a doctor; or setting up a 401K; everyday decisions have become increasingly complex due to the overwhelming abundance of choice with which we are presented. In The Paradox of Choice; Barry Schwartz explains why too much of a good thing has proven detrimental to our psychological and emotional well-being. In accessible; engaging; and anecdotal prose; Schwartz explains how a culture that thrives on the availability of constantly evolving options can also foster profound dissatisfaction and self-blame in individuals; which can lead to a paralysis in decision making and; in some cases; depression. With the latest studies on how we make choices in our personal and professional lives; Schwartz offers practical advice on how to focus on the right choices; and how to derive greater satisfaction from choices that we do make.

 The Time Travelers Wife,Audrey Niffenegger,A funny; often poignant tale of boy meets girl with a twist: what if one of them couldn't stop slipping in and out of time? Highly original and imaginative; this debut novel raises questions about life; love; and the effects of time on relationships.Audrey Niffenegger’s innovative debut; The Time Traveler’s Wife; is the story of Clare; a beautiful art student; and Henry; an adventuresome librarian; who have known each other since Clare was six and Henry was thirty-six; and were married when Clare was twenty-three and Henry thirty-one. Impossible but true; because Henry is one of the first people diagnosed with Chrono-Displacement Disorder: periodically his genetic clock resets and he finds himself misplaced in time; pulled to moments of emotional gravity in his life; past and future.

 A Brief History of Time,Stephen Hawking,In the ten years since its publication in 1988; Stephen Hawking's classic work has become a landmark volume in scientific writing; with more than nine million copies in forty languages sold worldwide. That edition was on the cutting edge of what was then known about the origins and nature of the universe. But the intervening years have seen extraordinary advances in the technology of observing both the micro- and the macrocosmic worlds. These observations have confirmed many of Professor Hawking's theoretical predictions in the first edition of his book; including the recent discoveries of the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE); which probed back in time to within 300;000 years of the universe's beginning and revealed wrinkles in the fabric of space-time that he had projected. Eager to bring to his original text the new knowledge revealed by these observations; as well as his own recent research; Professor Hawking has prepared a new introduction to the book; written an entirely new chapter on wormholes and time travel; and updated the chapters throughout.,4.18,315672,9217,romance,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3869.A_Brief_History_of_Time
 A Short History of Nearly Everything,Bill Bryson,In Bryson's biggest book; he confronts his greatest challenge: to understand—and; if possible; answer—the oldest; biggest questions we have posed about the universe and ourselves. Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization; Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end; he has attached himself to a host of the world’s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists; anthropologists; and mathematicians; travelling to their offices; laboratories; and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books; pestered them with questions; apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. A Short History of Nearly Everything is the record of this quest; and it is a sometimes profound; sometimes funny; and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge; as only Bill Bryson can render it. Science has never been more involving or entertaining.,4.19,310139,12677,romance,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21.A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything
 The Selfish Gene,Richard Dawkins,"Inheriting the mantle of revolutionary biologist from Darwin; Watson; and Crick; Richard Dawkins forced an enormous change in the way we see ourselves and the world with the publication of The Selfish Gene. Suppose; instead of thinking about organisms using genes to reproduce themselves; as we had since Mendel's work was rediscovered; we turn it around and imagine that ""our"" genes build and maintain us in order to make more genes. That simple reversal seems to answer many puzzlers which had stumped scientists for years; and we haven't thought of evolution in the same way since. Drawing fascinating examples from every field of biology; he paved the way for a serious re-evaluation of evolution. He also introduced the concept of self-reproducing ideas; or memes; which (seemingly) use humans exclusively for their propagation. If we are puppets; he says; at least we can try to understand our strings.",4.14,144426,3765,romance,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61535.The_Selfish_Gene
 Cosmos,Carl Sagan,Cosmos has 13 heavily illustrated chapters; corresponding to the 13 episodes of the Cosmos television series. In the book; Sagan explores 15 billion years of cosmic evolution and the development of science and civilization. Cosmos traces the origins of knowledge and the scientific method; mixing science and philosophy; and speculates to the future of science. The book also discusses the underlying premises of science by providing biographical anecdotes about many prominent scientists throughout history; placing their contributions into the broader context of the development of modern science.The book covers a broad range of topics; comprising Sagan's reflections on anthropological; cosmological; biological; historical; and astronomical matters from antiquity to contemporary times. Sagan reiterates his position on extraterrestrial life—that the magnitude of the universe permits the existence of thousands of alien civilizations; but no credible evidence exists to demonstrate that such life has ever visited earth.,4.37,119703,3252,romance,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55030.Cosmos
 The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,Rebecca Skloot,Her name was Henrietta Lacks; but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors; yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture; they are still alive today; though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale; they’d weigh more than 50 million metric tons—as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer; viruses; and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization; cloning; and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions.Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown; buried in an unmarked grave.Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey; from the “colored” ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta’s small; dying hometown of Clover; Virginia — a land of wooden slave quarters; faith healings; and voodoo — to East Baltimore today; where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells.Henrietta’s family did not learn of her “immortality” until more than twenty years after her death; when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials; her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows; the story of the Lacks family — past and present — is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans; the birth of bioethics; and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.Over the decade it took to uncover this story; Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family—especially Henrietta’s daughter Deborah; who was devastated to learn about her mother’s cells. She was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space? What happened to her sister; Elsie; who died in a mental institution at the age of fifteen? And if her mother was so important to medicine; why couldn’t her children afford health insurance?Intimate in feeling; astonishing in scope; and impossible to put down; The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery; as well as its human consequences.,4.07,604642,35072,romance,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6493208-the-immortal-life-of-henrietta-lacks

 Sapiens A Brief History of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari,100;000 years ago; at least six human species inhabited the earth. Today there is just one. Us. Homo sapiens. How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms?

 The Demon-Haunted World Science as a Candle in the Dark,Carl Sagan,How can we make intelligent decisions about our increasingly technology-driven lives if we don’t understand the difference between the myths of pseudoscience and the testable hypotheses of science? Pulitzer Prize-winning author and distinguished astronomer Carl Sagan argues that scientific thinking is critical not only to the pursuit of truth but to the very well-being of our democratic institutions.Casting a wide net through history and culture; Sagan examines and authoritatively debunks such celebrated fallacies of the past as witchcraft; faith healing; demons; and UFOs. And yet; disturbingly; in today's so-called information age; pseudoscience is burgeoning with stories of alien abduction; channeling past lives; and communal hallucinations commanding growing attention and respect. As Sagan demonstrates with lucid eloquence; the siren song of unreason is not just a cultural wrong turn but a dangerous plunge into darkness that threatens our most basic freedoms.,4.27,60704,2885,romance,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17349.The_Demon_Haunted_World

 The Grand Design,Stephen Hawking,THE FIRST MAJOR WORK IN NEARLY A DECADE BY ONE OF THE WORLD’S GREAT THINKERS—A MARVELOUSLY CONCISE BOOK WITH NEW ANSWERS TO THE ULTIMATE QUESTIONS OF LIFE When and how did the universe begin? Why are we here? Why is there something rather than nothing? What is the nature of reality? Why are the laws of nature so finely tuned as to allow for the existence of beings like ourselves? And; finally; is the apparent “grand design” of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who set things in motion—or does science offer another explanation? The most fundamental questions about the origins of the universe and of life itself; once the province of philosophy; now occupy the territory where scientists; philosophers; and theologians meet—if only to disagree. In their new book; Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow present the most recent scientific thinking about the mysteries of the universe; in nontechnical language marked by both brilliance and simplicity. In The Grand Design they explain that according to quantum theory; the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history; but rather that every possible history of the universe exists simultaneously. When applied to the universe as a whole; this idea calls into question the very notion of cause and effect. But the “top-down” approach to cosmology that Hawking and Mlodinow describe would say that the fact that the past takes no definite form means that we create history by observing it; rather than that history creates us. The authors further explain that we ourselves are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe; and show how quantum theory predicts the “multiverse”—the idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing; each with different laws of nature.Along the way Hawking and Mlodinow question the conventional concept of reality; posing a “model-dependent” theory of reality as the best we can hope to find. And they conclude with a riveting assessment of M-theory; an explanation of the laws governing us and our universe that is currently the only viable candidate for a complete “theory of everything.” If confirmed; they write; it will be the unified theory that Einstein was looking for; and the ultimate triumph of human reason.A succinct; startling; and lavishly illustrated guide to discoveries that are altering our understanding and threatening some of our most cherished belief systems; The Grand Design is a book that will inform—and provoke—like no other.',4.04,64933,2707,romance,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8520362-the-grand-design
 The Greatest Show on Earth The Evidence for Evolution,Richard Dawkins,Charles Darwin’s masterpiece; On the Origin of Species; shook society to its core on publication in 1859. Darwin was only too aware of the storm his theory of evolution would provoke but he would surely have raised an incredulous eyebrow at the controversy still raging a century and a half later. Evolution is accepted as scientific fact by all reputable scientists and indeed theologians; yet millions of people continue to question its veracity.In The Greatest Show on Earth Richard Dawkins takes on creationists; including followers of ‘Intelligent Design’ and all those who question the fact of evolution through natural selection. Like a detective arriving on the scene of a crime; he sifts through fascinating layers of scientific facts and disciplines to build a cast-iron case: from the living examples of natural selection in birds and insects; the ‘time clocks’ of trees and radioactive dating that calibrate a timescale for evolution; the fossil record and the traces of our earliest ancestors; to confirmation from molecular biology and genetics. All of this; and much more; bears witness to the truth of evolution.The Greatest Show on Earth comes at a critical time: systematic opposition to the fact of evolution is now flourishing as never before; especially in America. In Britain and elsewhere in the world; teachers witness insidious attempts to undermine the status of science in their classrooms. Richard Dawkins provides unequivocal evidence that boldly and comprehensively rebuts such nonsense. At the same time he shares with us his palpable love of the natural world and the essential role that science plays in its interpretation. Written with elegance; wit and passion; it is hard-hitting; absorbing and totally convincing.,4.15,49019,1925,romance,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6117055-the-greatest-show-on-earth

 The Gene An Intimate History,Siddhartha Mukherjee,Spanning the globe and several centuries; The Gene is the story of the quest to decipher the master-code that makes and defines humans; that governs our form and function.The story of the gene begins in an obscure Augustinian abbey in Moravia in 1856 where a monk stumbles on the idea of a ‘unit of heredity’. It intersects with Darwin’s theory of evolution; and collides with the horrors of Nazi eugenics in the 1940s. The gene transforms post-war biology. It reorganizes our understanding of sexuality; temperament; choice and free will. This is a story driven by human ingenuity and obsessive minds – from Charles Darwin and Gregor Mendel to Francis Crick; James Watson and Rosalind Franklin; and the thousands of scientists still working to understand the code of codes.This is an epic; moving history of a scientific idea coming to life; by the author of The Emperor of All Maladies. But woven through The Gene; like a red line; is also an intimate history – the story of Mukherjee’s own family and its recurring pattern of mental illness; reminding us that genetics is vitally relevant to everyday lives. These concerns reverberate even more urgently today as we learn to “read” and “write” the human genome – unleashing the potential to change the fates and identities of our children.Majestic in its ambition; and unflinching in its honesty; The Gene gives us a definitive account of the fundamental unit of heredity – and a vision of both humanity’s past and future.,4.34,34445,3394,romance,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27276428-the-gene
 The Emperor of All Maladies A Biography of Cancer,Siddhartha Mukherjee,Alternate Cover Edition ISBN 1439107955 (ISBN13: 9781439107959)The Emperor of All Maladies is a magnificent; profoundly humane “biography” of cancer - from its first documented appearances thousands of years ago through the epic battles in the twentieth century to cure; control; and conquer it to a radical new understanding of its essence. Physician; researcher; and award-winning science writer; Siddhartha Mukherjee examines cancer with a cellular biologist’s precision; a historian’s perspective; and a biographer’s passion. The result is an astonishingly lucid and eloquent chronicle of a disease humans have lived with - and perished from - for more than five thousand years. The story of cancer is a story of human ingenuity; resilience; and perseverance; but also of hubris; paternalism; and misperception. Mukherjee recounts centuries of discoveries; setbacks; victories; and deaths; told through the eyes of his predecessors and peers; training their wits against an infinitely resourceful adversary that; just three decades ago; was thought to be easily vanquished in an all-out “war against cancer.” The book reads like a literary thriller with cancer as the protagonist. From the Persian Queen Atossa; whose Greek slave cut off her malignant breast; to the nineteenth-century recipients of primitive radiation and chemotherapy to Mukherjee’s own leukemia patient; Carla; The Emperor of All Maladies is about the people who have soldiered through fiercely demanding regimens in order to survive—and to increase our understanding of this iconic disease. Riveting; urgent; and surprising; The Emperor of All Maladies provides a fascinating glimpse into the future of cancer treatments. It is an illuminating book that provides hope and clarity to those seeking to demystify cancer.,4.28,84259,6727,romance,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7170627-the-emperor-of-all-maladies
 The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical Tales,Oliver Sacks,If a man has lost a leg or an eye; he knows he has lost a leg or an eye; but if he has lost a self—himself—he cannot know it; because he is no longer there to know it. Dr. Oliver Sacks recounts the stories of patients struggling to adapt to often bizarre worlds of neurological disorder.

 The God Delusion,Richard Dawkins,A preeminent scientist - and the world's most prominent atheist - asserts the irrationality of belief in God; and the grievous harm religion has inflicted on society; from the Crusades to 9/11.With rigor and wit; Dawkins examines God in all his forms; from the sex-obsessed tyrant of the Old Testament; to the more benign (but still illogical) Celestial Watchmaker favored by some Enlightenment thinkers. He eviscerates the major arguments for religion; and demonstrates the supreme improbability of a supreme being. He shows how religion fuels war; foments bigotry; and abuses children; buttressing his points with historical and contemporary evidence.The God Delusion makes a compelling case that belief in God is not just wrong; but potentially deadly. It also offers exhilarating insight into the advantages of atheism to the individual and society; not the least of which is a clearer; truer appreciation of the universe's wonders than any faith could ever muster.,3.89,238001,8414,romance,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14743.The_God_Delusion
 The Fabric of the Cosmos Space; Time; and the Texture of Reality,Brian Greene,From Brian Greene; one of the world’s leading physicists and author the Pulitzer Prize finalist The Elegant Universe; comes a grand tour of the universe that makes us look at reality in a completely different way.Space and time form the very fabric of the cosmos. Yet they remain among the most mysterious of concepts. Is space an entity? Why does time have a direction? Could the universe exist without space and time? Can we travel to the past? Greene has set himself a daunting task: to explain non-intuitive; mathematical concepts like String Theory; the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle; and Inflationary Cosmology with analogies drawn from common experience. From Newton’s unchanging realm in which space and time are absolute; to Einstein’s fluid conception of spacetime; to quantum mechanics’ entangled arena where vastly distant objects can instantaneously coordinate their behavior; Greene takes us all; regardless of our scientific backgrounds; on an irresistible and revelatory journey to the new layers of reality that modern physics has discovered lying just beneath the surface of our everyday world.,4.11,35082,1060,romance,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22435.The_Fabric_of_the_Cosmos

 Homo Deus A History of Tomorrow,Yuval Noah Harari,Yuval Noah Harari; author of the critically-acclaimed New York Times bestseller and international phenomenon Sapiens; returns with an equally original; compelling; and provocative book; turning his focus toward humanity’s future; and our quest to upgrade humans into gods.Over the past century humankind has managed to do the impossible and rein in famine; plague; and war. This may seem hard to accept; but; as Harari explains in his trademark style—thorough; yet riveting—famine; plague and war have been transformed from incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces of nature into manageable challenges. For the first time ever; more people die from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers; terrorists and criminals put together. The average American is a thousand times more likely to die from binging at McDonalds than from being blown up by Al Qaeda.What then will replace famine; plague; and war at the top of the human agenda? As the self-made gods of planet earth; what destinies will we set ourselves; and which quests will we undertake? Homo Deus explores the projects; dreams and nightmares that will shape the twenty-first century—from overcoming death to creating artificial life. It asks the fundamental questions: Where do we go from here? And how will we protect this fragile world from our own destructive powers? This is the next stage of evolution.

 Enders Game,Orson Scott Card,"Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin thinks he is playing computer simulated war games; he is; in fact; engaged in something far more desperate. The result of genetic experimentation; Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training; to chip away and find the diamond inside; or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years; and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings; Peter and Valentine; are every bit as unusual as he is; but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent; Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender; and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process; to become a ruler.

 The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fck A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life,Mark Manson,"Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780062457738In this generation-defining self-help guide; a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be ""positive"" all the time so that we can truly become better; happier people.For decades; we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy; rich life. ""F**k positivity;"" Mark Manson says. ""Let’s be honest; shit is f**ked and we have to live with it."" In his wildly popular Internet blog; Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw; refreshing; honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling; let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation; rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.Manson makes the argument; backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes; that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade; but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—""not everybody can be extraordinary; there are winners and losers in society; and some of it is not fair or your fault."" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears; faults; and uncertainties; once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths; we can begin to find the courage; perseverance; honesty; responsibility; curiosity; and forgiveness we seek.There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter; Manson makes clear. While money is nice; caring about what you do with your life is better; because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk; filled with entertaining stories and profane; ruthless humor; The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented; grounded lives.",3.93,573890,35516,science-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28257707-the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck

 The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People Powerful Lessons in Personal Change,Stephen R. Covey,When Stephen Covey first released The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People; the book became an instant rage because people suddenly got up and took notice that their lives were headed off in the wrong direction; and more than that; they realized that there were so many simple things they could do in order to navigate their life correctly. This book was wonderful education for people; education in how to live life effectively and get closer to the ideal of being a ‘success’ in life.But not everyone understands Stephen Covey’s model fully well; or maybe there are some people who haven’t read it yet. This is definitely true because we still see so much failure all around us. Now; I am not saying that by using Covey’s model; or anyone else’s model for that matter; you can become a sure-shot success; but at least we should have seen many more successes around us already judging by the number of copies the book has sold! So; where is the shortcoming?There are two main problems here; and we are talking only about the people who have read the book already. The first problem is that most people are too lazy to implement the ideals of Stephen Covey in their lives. They consider his masterpiece of a book as a mere coffee-table book or a book that you use for light reading when you are traveling and then forget all about it. They do not realize that this book contains life-changing information. Or; they take the information and do not make the effort to actually utilize it so that it becomes knowledge for them.The second problem is that a lot of people have a myopic view of Covey’s ideals. These are people who are impressed by the book already. If you ask them what the seven habits are; they can rattle them off end to end; but then they miss the larger picture. They do not understand that Covey was trying to tell more than he wrote in words. There are hidden implications in this book; yes; and a lot of people have just failed to see through them.That is what we are trying to do. We are trying to show you how Covey’s book; or rather; his model; was a complete model in itself. There was nothing amiss about it. If you implement it; there should be no aspect of your life that should go untouched. The only thing is that you have to understand these ideals and try to implement them in your life.But; before we barge into that area; it is extremely important to understand what these ideals are. What was the model that was propounded by Stephen Covey in his mega-famous book? We shall begin by trying to understand his model first; and then interpret it in such a way that it pertains to every aspect of our life,4.12,545844,10823,science-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36072.The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People
 The Power of Habit Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business,Charles Duhigg,A young woman walks into a laboratory. Over the past two years; she has transformed almost every aspect of her life. She has quit smoking; run a marathon; and been promoted at work. The patterns inside her brain; neurologists discover; have fundamentally changed.Marketers at Procter & Gamble study videos of people making their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze; on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly; one of them detects a nearly imperceptible pattern—and with a slight shift in advertising; Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year.An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employees—how they approach worker safety—and soon the firm; Alcoa; becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones.What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives. They succeeded by transforming habits.In The Power of Habit; award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives; Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation. Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change; despite years of trying; while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where; exactly; they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps; Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz; and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King; Jr. We go inside Procter & Gamble; Target superstores; Rick Warren’s Saddleback Church; NFL locker rooms; and the nation’s largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success; life and death.At its core; The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly; losing weight; raising exceptional children; becoming more productive; building revolutionary companies and social movements; and achieving success is understanding how habits work. Habits aren’t destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows; by harnessing this new science; we can transform our businesses; our communities; and our lives.,4.11,361257,17689,science-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12609433-the-power-of-habit

 Quiet The Power of Introverts in a World That Cant Stop Talking,Susan Cain,The book that started the Quiet RevolutionAt least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introverts—Rosa Parks; Chopin; Dr. Seuss; Steve Wozniak—that we owe many of the great contributions to society. In Quiet; Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts—from a witty; high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks; to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Passionately argued; superbly researched; and filled with indelible stories of real people; Quiet has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and; equally important; how they see themselves.Now with Extra Libris material; including a reader’s guide and bonus content.,4.06,337592,24119,science-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8520610-quiet

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; . . . who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement; and who at worst; if he fails; at least fails while daring greatly.” —Theodore RooseveltEvery day we experience the uncertainty; risks; and emotional exposure that define what it means to be vulnerable; or to dare greatly. Whether the arena is a new relationship; an important meeting; our creative process; or a difficult family conversation; we must find the courage to walk into vulnerability and engage with our whole hearts.In Daring Greatly; Dr. Brown challenges everything we think we know about vulnerability. Based on twelve years of research; she argues that vulnerability is not weakness; but rather our clearest path to courage; engagement; and meaningful connection. The book that Dr. Brown’s many fans have been waiting for; Daring Greatly will spark a new spirit of truth—and trust—in our organizations; families; schools; and communities.,4.26,139324,9310,science-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13588356-daring-greatly

 10 Happier How I Tamed the Voice in My Head; Reduced Stress Without Losing My Edge; and Found Self-Help That Actually Works,Dan   Harris,Nightline anchor Dan Harris embarks on an unexpected; hilarious; and deeply skeptical odyssey through the strange worlds of spirituality and self-help; and discovers a way to get happier that is truly achievable.After having a nationally televised panic attack on Good Morning America; Dan Harris knew he had to make some changes. A lifelong nonbeliever; he found himself on a bizarre adventure; involving a disgraced pastor; a mysterious self-help guru; and a gaggle of brain scientists. Eventually; Harris realized that the source of his problems was the very thing he always thought was his greatest asset: the incessant; insatiable voice in his head; which had both propelled him through the ranks of a hyper-competitive business and also led him to make the profoundly stupid decisions that provoked his on-air freak-out.We all have a voice in our head. It’s what has us losing our temper unnecessarily; checking our email compulsively; eating when we’re not hungry; and fixating on the past and the future at the expense of the present. Most of us would assume we’re stuck with this voice – that there’s nothing we can do to rein it in – but Harris stumbled upon an effective way to do just that. It’s a far cry from the miracle cures peddled by the self-help swamis he met; instead; it’s something he always assumed to be either impossible or useless: meditation. After learning about research that suggests meditation can do everything from lower your blood pressure to essentially rewire your brain; Harris took a deep dive into the underreported world of CEOs; scientists; and even marines who are now using it for increased calm; focus; and happiness.10% Happier takes readers on a ride from the outer reaches of neuroscience to the inner sanctum of network news to the bizarre fringes of America’s spiritual scene; and leaves them with a takeaway that could actually change their lives.,3.92,83840,6334,science-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18505796-10-happier

It’s about getting only the right things done.  It is not  a time management strategy; or a productivity technique. It is a systematic discipline for discerning what is absolutely essential; then eliminating everything that is not; so we can make the highest possible contribution towards the things that really matter.  By forcing us to apply a more selective criteria for what is Essential; the disciplined pursuit of less empowers us to reclaim control of our own choices about where to spend our precious time and energy – instead of giving others the implicit permission to choose for us.Essentialism is not one more thing – it’s a whole new way of doing everything.

Blink is a book about how we think without thinking; about choices that seem to be made in an instant - in the blink of an eye - that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers; while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win; while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work - in the office; in the classroom; in the kitchen; and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?

Here; too; are great failures of ""blink"": the election of Warren Harding; ""New Coke""; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police.

 Braving the Wilderness The Quest for True Belonging and the Courage to Stand Alone,Brené Brown,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER - A timely and important new book that challenges everything we think we know about cultivating true belonging in our communities; organizations; and culture; from the #1 bestselling author of Rising Strong; Daring Greatly; and The Gifts of Imperfection""True belonging doesn't require us to change who we are. It requires us to be who we are."" Social scientist Brene Brown; PhD; LMSW; has sparked a global conversation about the experiences that bring meaning to our lives--experiences of courage; vulnerability; love; belonging; shame; and empathy. In Braving the Wilderness;  Brown redefines what it means to truly belong in an age of increased polarization. With her trademark mix of research; storytelling; and honesty; Brown will again change the cultural conversation while mapping a clear path to true belonging.Brown argues that we're experiencing a spiritual crisis of disconnection; and introduces four practices of true belonging that challenge everything we believe about ourselves and each other. She writes; ""True belonging requires us to believe in and belong to ourselves so fully that we can find sacredness both in being a part of something and in standing alone when necessary. But in a culture that's rife with perfectionism and pleasing; and with the erosion of civility; it's easy to stay quiet; hide in our ideological bunkers; or fit in rather than show up as our true selves and brave the wilderness of uncertainty and criticism. But true belonging is not something we negotiate or accomplish with others; it's a daily practice that demands integrity and authenticity. It's a personal commitment that we carry in our hearts."" Brown offers us the clarity and courage we need to find our way back to ourselves and to each other. And that path cuts right through the wilderness. Brown writes; ""The wilderness is an untamed; unpredictable place of solitude and searching. It is a place as dangerous as it is breathtaking; a place as sought after as it is feared. But it turns out to be the place of true belonging; and it's the bravest and most sacred place you will ever stand.""",4.14,70721,5918,science-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34565022-braving-the-wilderness

 The Willpower Instinct How Self-Control Works; Why It Matters; and What You Can Do to Get More of It,Kelly McGonigal,"The first book to explain the new science of self-control and how it can be harnessed to improve our health; happiness; and productivity.After years of watching her students struggling with their choices; health psychologist Kelly McGonigal; Ph.D.; realized that much of what people believe about willpower is actually sabotaging their success. Committed to sharing what the scientific community already knew about self-control; McGonigal created a course called ""The Science of Willpower"" for Stanford University's Continuing Studies Program. The course was an instant hit and spawned the hugely successful Psychology Today blog with the same name.Informed by the latest research and combining cutting-edge insights from psychology; economics; neuroscience; and medicine; McGonigal's book explains exactly what willpower is; how it works; and why it matters. Readers will learn:Willpower is a mind-body response; not a virtue. It is a biological function that can be improved through mindfulness; exercise; nutrition; and sleep. People who have better control of their attention; emotions; and actions are healthier; happier; have more satisfying relationships; and make more money. Willpower is not an unlimited resource. Too much self-control can actually be bad for your health. Temptation and stress hijack the brain's systems of self-control; and that the brain can be trained for greater willpower.In the groundbreaking tradition of Getting Things Done; The Willpower Instinct combines life-changing prescriptive advice and complementary exercises to help readers with goals ranging from a healthier life to more patient parenting; from greater productivity at work to finally finishing the basement.",4.14,27182,1831,science-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10865206-the-willpower-instinct
 Better Than Before Mastering the Habits of Our Everyday Lives,Gretchen Rubin,New York Times BestsellerWashington Post Bestseller The author of the blockbuster New York Times bestsellers; The Happiness Project and Happier at Home; tackles the critical question: How do we change?    Gretchen Rubin's answer: through habits. Habits are the invisible architecture of everyday life. It takes work to make a habit; but once that habit is set; we can harness the energy of habits to build happier; stronger; more productive lives.   So if habits are a key to change; then what we really need to know is: How do we change our habits?  Better than Before answers that question. It presents a practical; concrete framework to allow readers to understand their habits—and to change them for good. Infused with Rubin’s compelling voice; rigorous research; and easy humor; and packed with vivid stories of lives transformed; Better than Before explains the (sometimes counter-intuitive) core principles of habit formation.    Along the way; Rubin uses herself as guinea pig; tests her theories on family and friends; and answers readers’ most pressing questions—oddly; questions that other writers and researchers tend to ignore: • Why do I find it tough to create a habit for something I love to do? • Sometimes I can change a habit overnight; and sometimes I can’t change a habit; no matter how hard I try. Why? • How quickly can I change a habit? • What can I do to make sure I stick to a new habit? • How can I help someone else change a habit? • Why can I keep habits that benefit others; but can’t make habits that are just for me?  Whether readers want to get more sleep; stop checking their devices; maintain a healthy weight; or finish an important project; habits make change possible. Reading just a few chapters of Better Than Before will make readers eager to start work on their own habits—even before they’ve finished the book.,3.84,34909,3505,science-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22889767-better-than-before

 Boundaries When to Say Yes; How to Say No to Take Control of Your Life,Henry Cloud,Having clear boundaries is essential to a healthy; balanced lifestyle. A boundary is a personal property line that marks those things for which we are responsible. In other words; boundaries define who we are and who we are not. Boundaries impact all areas of our lives: Physical boundaries help us determine who may touch us and under what circumstances -- Mental boundaries give us the freedom to have our own thoughts and opinions -- Emotional boundaries help us to deal with our own emotions and disengage from the harmful; manipulative emotions of others -- Spiritual boundaries help us to distinguish God's will from our own and give us renewed awe for our Creator -- Often; Christians focus so much on being loving and unselfish that they forget their own limits and limitations. When confronted with their lack of boundaries; they ask: - Can I set limits and still be a loving person? - What are legitimate boundaries? - What if someone is upset or hurt by my boundaries? - How do I answer someone who wants my time; love; energy; or money? - Aren't boundaries selfish? - Why do I feel guilty or afraid when I consider setting boundaries? Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. John Townsend offer biblically-based answers to these and other tough questions; showing us how to set healthy boundaries with our parents; spouses; children; friends; co-workers; and even ourselves.,4.20,53451,3295,science-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/944267.Boundaries
 Digital Minimalism Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World,Cal Newport,"Minimalism is the art of knowing how much is just enough. Digital minimalism applies this idea to our personal technology. It's the key to living a focused life in an increasingly noisy world.In this timely and enlightening book; the bestselling author of Deep Work introduces a philosophy for technology use that has already improved countless lives.Digital minimalists are all around us. They're the calm; happy people who can hold long conversations without furtive glances at their phones. They can get lost in a good book; a woodworking project; or a leisurely morning run. They can have fun with friends and family without the obsessive urge to document the experience. They stay informed about the news of the day; but don't feel overwhelmed by it. They don't experience ""fear of missing out"" because they already know which activities provide them meaning and satisfaction.Now; Newport gives us a name for this quiet movement; and makes a persuasive case for its urgency in our tech-saturated world. Common sense tips; like turning off notifications; or occasional rituals like observing a digital sabbath; don't go far enough in helping us take back control of our technological lives; and attempts to unplug completely are complicated by the demands of family; friends and work. What we need instead is a thoughtful method to decide what tools to use; for what purposes; and under what conditions.Drawing on a diverse array of real-life examples; from Amish farmers to harried parents to Silicon Valley programmers; Newport identifies the common practices of digital minimalists and the ideas that underpin them. He shows how digital minimalists are rethinking their relationship to social media; rediscovering the pleasures of the offline world; and reconnecting with their inner selves through regular periods of solitude. He then shares strategies for integrating these practices into your life; starting with a thirty-day ""digital declutter"" process that has already helped thousands feel less overwhelmed and more in control.Technology is intrinsically neither good nor bad. The key is using it to support your goals and values; rather than letting it use you. This book shows the way.",4.07,37323,4305,science-fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40672036-digital-minimalism

 Moneyball The Art of Winning an Unfair Game,Michael   Lewis,Billy Beane; general manager of MLB's Oakland A's and protagonist of Michael Lewis's Moneyball; had a problem: how to win in the Major Leagues with a budget that's smaller than that of nearly every other team. Conventional wisdom long held that big name; highly athletic hitters and young pitchers with rocket arms were the ticket to success. But Beane and his staff; buoyed by massive amounts of carefully interpreted statistical data; believed that wins could be had by more affordable methods such as hitters with high on-base percentage and pitchers who get lots of ground outs. Given this information and a tight budget; Beane defied tradition and his own scouting department to build winning teams of young affordable players and inexpensive castoff veterans.  Lewis was in the room with the A's top management as they spent the summer of 2002 adding and subtracting players and he provides outstanding play-by-play. In the June player draft; Beane acquired nearly every prospect he coveted (few of whom were coveted by other teams) and at the July trading deadline he engaged in a tense battle of nerves to acquire a lefty reliever. Besides being one of the most insider accounts ever written about baseball; Moneyball is populated with fascinating characters. We meet Jeremy Brown; an overweight college catcher who most teams project to be a 15th round draft pick (Beane takes him in the first). Sidearm pitcher Chad Bradford is plucked from the White Sox triple-A club to be a key set-up man and catcher Scott Hatteberg is rebuilt as a first baseman. But the most interesting character is Beane himself. A speedy athletic can't-miss prospect who somehow missed; Beane reinvents himself as a front-office guru; relying on players completely unlike; say; Billy Beane. Lewis; one of the top nonfiction writers of his era (Liar's Poker; The New New Thing); offers highly accessible explanations of baseball stats and his roadmap of Beane's economic approach makes Moneyball an appealing reading experience for business people and sports fans alike. --John Moe,4.25,105020,5074,self-help,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1301.Moneyball

 Born to Run A Hidden Tribe; Superathletes; and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen,Christopher McDougall,Full of incredible characters; amazing athletic achievements; cutting-edge science; and; most of all; pure inspiration; Born to Run is an epic adventure that began with one simple question: Why does my foot hurt? In search of an answer; Christopher McDougall sets off to find a tribe of the world’s greatest distance runners and learn their secrets; and in the process shows us that everything we thought we knew about running is wrong.Isolated by the most savage terrain in North America; the reclusive Tarahumara Indians of Mexico’s deadly Copper Canyons are custodians of a lost art. For centuries they have practiced techniques that allow them to run hundreds of miles without rest and chase down anything from a deer to an Olympic marathoner while enjoying every mile of it. Their superhuman talent is matched by uncanny health and serenity; leaving the Tarahumara immune to the diseases and strife that plague modern existence. With the help of Caballo Blanco; a mysterious loner who lives among the tribe; the author was able not only to uncover the secrets of the Tarahumara but also to find his own inner ultra-athlete; as he trained for the challenge of a lifetime: a fifty-mile race through the heart of Tarahumara country pitting the tribe against an odd band of Americans; including a star ultramarathoner; a beautiful young surfer; and a barefoot wonder.With a sharp wit and wild exuberance; McDougall takes us from the high-tech science labs at Harvard to the sun-baked valleys and freezing peaks across North America; where ever-growing numbers of ultrarunners are pushing their bodies to the limit; and; finally; to the climactic race in the Copper Canyons.

 Open,Andre Agassi,From Andre Agassi; one of the most beloved athletes in history and one of the most gifted men ever to step onto a tennis court; a beautiful; haunting autobiography.Agassi’s incredibly rigorous training begins when he is just a child. By the age of thirteen; he is banished to a Florida tennis camp that feels like a prison camp. Lonely; scared; a ninth-grade dropout; he rebels in ways that will soon make him a 1980s icon. He dyes his hair; pierces his ears; dresses like a punk rocker. By the time he turns pro at sixteen; his new look promises to change tennis forever; as does his lightning-fast return. And yet; despite his raw talent; he struggles early on. We feel his confusion as he loses to the world’s best; his greater confusion as he starts to win. After stumbling in three Grand Slam finals; Agassi shocks the world; and himself; by capturing the 1992 Wimbledon. Overnight he becomes a fan favorite and a media target.Agassi brings a near-photographic memory to every pivotal match and every relationship. Never before has the inner game of tennis and the outer game of fame been so precisely limned. Alongside vivid portraits of rivals from several generations—Jimmy Connors; Pete Sampras; Roger Federer—Agassi gives unstinting accounts of his brief time with Barbra Streisand and his doomed marriage to Brooke Shields. He reveals a shattering loss of confidence. And he recounts his spectacular resurrection; a comeback climaxing with his epic run at the 1999 French Open and his march to become the oldest man ever ranked number one.In clear; taut prose; Agassi evokes his loyal brother; his wise coach; his gentle trainer; all the people who help him regain his balance and find love at last with Stefanie Graf. Inspired by her quiet strength; he fights through crippling pain from a deteriorating spine to remain a dangerous opponent in the twenty-first and final year of his career. Entering his last tournament in 2006; he’s hailed for completing a stunning metamorphosis; from nonconformist to elder statesman; from dropout to education advocate. And still he’s not done. At a U.S. Open for the ages; he makes a courageous last stand; then delivers one of the most stirring farewells ever heard in a sporting arena.With its breakneck tempo and raw candor; Open will be read and cherished for years. A treat for ardent fans; it will also captivate readers who know nothing about tennis. Like Agassi’s game; it sets a new standard for grace; style; speed; and power.,4.25,84741,6608,self-help,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6480781-open

 The Book of Basketball The NBA According to The Sports Guy,Bill Simmons,There is only one writer on the planet who possesses enough basketball knowledge and passion to write the definitive book on the NBA.* Bill Simmons; the from-the-womb hoops addict known to millions as ESPN.com’s Sports Guy; is that writer. And The Book of Basketball is that book. Nowhere in the roundball universe will you find another single volume that covers as much in such depth as this wildly opinionated and thoroughly entertaining look at the past; present; and future of pro basketball.From the age-old question of who actually won the rivalry between Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain to the one about which team was truly the best of all time; Simmons opens–and then closes; once and for all–every major pro basketball debate. Then he takes it further by completely reevaluating not only how NBA Hall of Fame inductees should be chosen but how the institution must be reshaped from the ground up; the result being the Pyramid: Simmons’s one-of-a-kind; five-level shrine to the ninety-six greatest players in the history of pro basketball. And ultimately he takes fans to the heart of it all; as he uses a conversation with one NBA great to uncover that coveted thing: The Secret of Basketball.Comprehensive; authoritative; controversial; hilarious; and impossible to put down (even for Celtic-haters); The Book of Basketball offers every hardwood fan a courtside seat beside the game’s finest; funniest; and fiercest chronicler.* More to the point; he’s the only one crazy enough to try to pull it off. ,4.19,31838,1050,self-help,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4452257-the-book-of-basketball

Since then; he’s made an art of hiding his sexuality from everyone. Including himself.  So it’s a shock when his past strolls right into the Harkness College locker room; sporting a bag of hockey gear and the same slow smile that had always rendered Graham defenseless. For Graham; there is only one possible reaction: total; debilitating panic. With one loose word; the team’s new left wing could destroy Graham’s life as he knows it.  John Rikker is stuck being the new guy. Again. And it’s worse than usual; because the media has latched onto the story of the only “out” player in Division One hockey.

 Eat; Pray; Love,Elizabeth Gilbert,A celebrated writer's irresistible; candid; and eloquent account of her pursuit of worldly pleasure; spiritual devotion; and what she really wanted out of life. Around the time Elizabeth Gilbert turned thirty; she went through an early-onslaught midlife crisis. She had everything an educated; ambitious American woman was supposed to want—a husband; a house; a successful career. But instead of feeling happy and fulfilled; she was consumed with panic; grief; and confusion. She went through a divorce; a crushing depression; another failed love; and the eradication of everything she ever thought she was supposed to be. To recover from all this; Gilbert took a radical step. In order to give herself the time and space to find out who she really was and what she really wanted; she got rid of her belongings; quit her job; and undertook a yearlong journey around the world—all alone. Eat; Pray; Love is the absorbing chronicle of that year. Her aim was to visit three places where she could examine one aspect of her own nature set against the backdrop of a culture that has traditionally done that one thing very well. In Rome; she studied the art of pleasure; learning to speak Italian and gaining the twenty-three happiest pounds of her life. India was for the art of devotion; and with the help of a native guru and a surprisingly wise cowboy from Texas; she embarked on four uninterrupted months of spiritual exploration. In Bali; she studied the art of balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence. She became the pupil of an elderly medicine man and also fell in love the best way—unexpectedly. An intensely articulate and moving memoir of self-discovery; Eat; Pray; Love is about what can happen when you claim responsibility for your own contentment and stop trying to live in imitation of society’s ideals. It is certain to touch anyone who has ever woken up to the unrelenting need for change.,3.57,1508922,54170,thriller,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19501.Eat_Pray_Love

After ten years in England; he returned to the land of his youth; and drove almost 14;000 miles in search of a mythical small town called Amalgam; the kind of trim and sunny place where the films of his youth were set. Instead; his search led him to Anywhere; USA; a lookalike strip of gas stations; motels and hamburger outlets populated by lookalike people with a penchant for synthetic fibres. Travelling around thirty-eight of the lower states - united only in their mind-numbingly dreary uniformity - he discovered a continent that was doubly lost; lost to itself because blighted by greed; pollution; mobile homes and television; lost to him because he had become a stranger in his own land.The Lost Continent is a classic of travel literature - hilariously; stomach-achingly funny; yet tinged with heartache - and the book that first staked Bill Bryson's claim as the most beloved writer of his generation.,3.83,52845,2790,thriller,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26.The_Lost_Continent

 The Places in Between,Rory Stewart,In January 2002 Rory Stewart walked across Afghanistan-surviving by his wits; his knowledge of Persian dialects and Muslim customs; and the kindness of strangers. By day he passed through mountains covered in nine feet of snow; hamlets burned and emptied by the Taliban; and communities thriving amid the remains of medieval civilizations. By night he slept on villagers' floors; shared their meals; and listened to their stories of the recent and ancient past. Along the way Stewart met heroes and rogues; tribal elders and teenage soldiers; Taliban commanders and foreign-aid workers. He was also adopted by an unexpected companion-a retired fighting mastiff he named Babur in honor of Afghanistan's first Mughal emperor; in whose footsteps the pair was following. Through these encounters--by turns touching; confounding; surprising; and funny--Stewart makes tangible the forces of tradition; ideology; and allegiance that shape life in the map's countless places in between.,3.91,14296,1456,thriller,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95643.The_Places_in_Between

In short; he traverses all of Asia top to bottom; and end to end. In the three decades since he first travelled this route; Asia has undergone phenomenal change. The Soviet Union has collapsed; China has risen; India booms; Burma slowly smothers; and Vietnam prospers despite the havoc unleashed upon it the last time Theroux passed through. He witnesses all this and so much more in a 25;000 mile journey; travelling as the locals do; by train; car; bus; and foot.His odyssey takes him from Eastern Europe; still hungover from Communism; through tense but thriving Turkey; into the Caucasus; where Georgia limps back toward feudalism while its neighbour Azerbaijan revels in oil-driven capitalism. As he penetrates deeper into Asia’s heart; his encounters take on an otherworldly cast. The two chapters that follow show us Turkmenistan; a profoundly isolated society at the mercy of an almost comically egotistical dictator; and Uzbekistan; a ruthless authoritarian state. From there; he retraces his steps through India; Mayanmar; China; and Japan; providing his penetrating observations on the changes these countries have undergone.Brilliant; caustic; and totally addictive; Ghost Train to the Eastern Star is Theroux at his very best.,4.03,6223,482,thriller,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2071926.Ghost_Train_to_the_Eastern_Star

The novel tells the story of Ponyboy Curtis and his struggles with right and wrong in a society in which he believes that he is an outsider. According to Ponyboy; there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for ""social"") has money; can get away with just about anything; and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser; on the other hand; always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser; and he's always been proud of it; even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy's skin; causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser.Librarian note: This record is for one of the three editions published with different covers and with ISBN 0-140-38572-X / 978-0-14-038572-4.
